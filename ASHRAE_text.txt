Many cooling load components vary widely in magnitude, and possibly direction, during a 24 h period. Because these cyclic changes in
load components often are not in phase with each other, each component must be analyzed to establish the maximum cooling load for
a building or zone. A zoned system (i.e., one serving several independent areas, each with its own temperature control) needs to provide no greater total cooling load capacity than the largest hourly
sum of simultaneous zone loads throughout a design day; however,
it must handle the peak cooling load for each zone at its individual
peak hour. At some times of day during heating or intermediate seasons, some zones may require heating while others require cooling.
The zones’ ventilation, humidification, or dehumidification needs
must also be considered.
The current terminology presented here has been developed over
time based on the assumption that heat will be removed from a space
through a convective- (air system) based cooling process. ASHRAE
research project RP-1729 (Moftakhari et al. 2020) shows that when
cooling is provided through a predominantly radiant-based cooling
system, conversion of heat gain to cooling load can differ from convective-based systems. It is always important to distinguish between
room load and HVAC system load. This is true for both convectivebased and radiant cooling systems. This chapter deals with calculation of the room cooling load. For radiant cooling systems, those
room loads should be applied to calculation of HVAC system loads
using principles described in Chapter 6 of the 2020 ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems and Equipment. This current chapter is largely
based on convective or air-system-based cooling, but some key differences that would exist with radiant systems will be pointed out.

EATING and cooling load calculations are the primary design
basis for most heating and air-conditioning systems and components. These calculations affect the size of piping, ductwork, diffusers, air handlers, boilers, chillers, coils, compressors, fans, and
every other component of systems that condition indoor environments. Cooling and heating load calculations can significantly affect
first cost of building construction, comfort and productivity of occupants, and operating cost and energy consumption.
Simply put, heating and cooling loads are the rates of energy
input (heating) or removal (cooling) required to maintain an indoor
environment at a desired temperature and humidity condition. Heating and air conditioning systems are designed, sized, and controlled
to accomplish that energy transfer. The amount of heating or cooling
required at any particular time varies widely, depending on external
(e.g., outdoor temperature) and internal (e.g., number of people
occupying a space) factors.
Peak design heating and cooling load calculations, which are this
chapter’s focus, seek to determine the maximum rate of heating and
cooling energy transfer needed to maintain the space conditions at
the desired level (set point). Similar principles, but with different
assumptions, data, and application, can be used to estimate building
energy consumption, as described in Chapter 19.
This chapter discusses common elements of cooling and heating
load calculation (e.g., internal heat gain, ventilation and infiltration,
moisture migration, fenestration heat gain) and two methods of heating and cooling load estimation: heat balance (HB) and radiant time
series (RTS).

Heat Flow Rates

Cooling loads result from many conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer processes through the building envelope and from
internal sources and system components. Building components or
contents that may affect cooling loads include the following:
• External: Walls, roofs, windows, skylights, doors, partitions, ceilings, and floors
• Internal: Lights, people, appliances, and equipment
• Infiltration: Air leakage and moisture migration
• System: Outdoor air, duct leakage and heat gain, reheat, fan and
pump energy, and energy recovery

TERMINOLOGY

The variables affecting cooling load calculations are numerous,
often difficult to define precisely, and always intricately interrelated.
The preparation of this chapter is assigned to TC 4.1, Load Calculation Data
and Procedures.

18.1

In air-conditioning design, the following four related heat flow
rates, each of which varies with time, must be differentiated.
Space Heat Gain. This instantaneous rate of heat gain is the rate
at which heat enters into and/or is generated within a space. Heat
gain is classified by its mode of entry into the space and whether it
is sensible or latent. Entry modes include (1) solar radiation through
transparent surfaces; (2) heat conduction through exterior walls and
roofs; (3) heat conduction through ceilings, floors, and interior partitions; (4) heat generated in the space by occupants, lights, and
appliances; (5) heat transfer through direct-with-space ventilation
and infiltration of outdoor air; and (6) miscellaneous heat gains. Sensible heat is added directly to the conditioned space by conduction,
convection, and/or radiation. Latent heat gain occurs when moisture is added to the space (e.g., from vapor emitted by occupants and
equipment). To maintain a constant humidity ratio, water vapor must
condense on the cooling apparatus and be removed at the same rate
it is added to the space. The amount of energy required to offset
latent heat gain essentially equals the product of the condensation
rate and latent heat of condensation. In selecting cooling equipment,
distinguish between sensible and latent heat gain: every cooling

Instantaneous Heat Gain and Instantaneous Cooling Load
apparatus has different maximum removal capacities for sensible
versus latent heat for particular operating conditions. In extremely
dry climates, humidification may be required, rather than dehumidification, to maintain thermal comfort.
Radiant Heat Gain. Radiant heat gain will first be absorbed by
surfaces that enclose the space (walls, floor, and ceiling) and objects
in the space (furniture, etc.). With convective or air-based cooling
systems, these surfaces and objects become warmer than the surrounding air and some of their heat transfers to the air by convection. The composite heat storage capacity of these surfaces and
objects determines the rate at which their respective surface temperatures increase for a given radiant input, and thus governs the
relationship between the radiant portion of heat gain and its corresponding conversion to space cooling load (Figure 1). The thermal
storage effect is critical in differentiating between instantaneous
heat gain for a given space and its cooling load at that moment. Predicting the nature and magnitude of this phenomenon to estimate a
realistic cooling load for a particular set of circumstances has long
been of interest to design engineers; the Bibliography lists some
early work on the subject.
With radiant-based cooling systems, radiant gains are still
absorbed by surfaces in the space but the process of conversion from
radiant heat gains to cooling load can be very different than would
occur with convective or air-based cooling systems. The first difference occurs if the radiant gain strikes the radiant cooling surface
directly. In this case, the radiant gain is converted to cooling load
immediately as the heat is absorbed directly by the active radiant
cooling system. Other radiant gains are absorbed by nonactive surfaces in the space. In these cases, though, the heat gain could be converted to cooling load either by convection to the space air or through
radiation exchange with the active radiant cooling surface. ASHRAE
research project RP-1729 (Moftakhari et al. 2020) found that in general, the radiant system maintains nonactive surfaces at a temperature
below the room air and that most absorbed radiant gains are converted to cooling load by exchange with the radiant cooling system.
This resulted in less stored heat and less time lag between the heat
gain and its conversion to cooling load as compared to conventional
air based systems.
The heat transfer mechanics of the conversion of radiant heat
gains to cooling load does not depend on the mass of the radiant
cooling device. All radiant exchange between the cooling device
and the space is through the exposed surface of the device. The position, configuration, and surface area of the device can result in different heat transfer dynamics. For example, a radiant cooling floor
interacts differently with direct solar gain than a radiant ceiling
would for a given space. The same might be true for radiant gain
from ceiling-mounted lighting, though RP-1729 performed experiments only for the case of radiant ceiling panels. Computer modeling was done to explore the differences between ceiling- and floormounted radiant cooling devices, verifying these conclusions.

Fig. 2

Thermal Storage Effect in Cooling Load from Lights

Space Cooling Load. This is the rate at which sensible and latent
heat must be removed from the space to maintain a constant space
air temperature and humidity. The sum of all space instantaneous
heat gains at any given time does not necessarily (or even frequently) equal the cooling load for the space at that same time
because of the effect of radiant gains being stored in the building
mass, as described previously.
Space Heat Extraction Rate. The rates at which sensible and
latent heat are removed from the conditioned space equal the space
cooling load when the room air temperature and humidity are constant. Along with the intermittent operation of cooling equipment,
control systems usually allow a minor cyclic variation or swing in
room temperature; humidity is often allowed to float, but it can be
controlled. Therefore, proper simulation of the control system gives
a more realistic value of energy removal over a fixed period than
using values of the space cooling load. However, this is primarily
important for estimating energy use over time; it is not needed to
calculate design peak cooling load for equipment selection.
Cooling Coil Load. The rate at which energy is removed at a
cooling coil serving one or more conditioned spaces equals the sum
of instantaneous space cooling loads (or space heat extraction rate,
if it is assumed that space temperature and humidity vary) for all
spaces served by the coil, plus any system loads. System loads
include fan heat gain, duct heat gain, and outdoor air heat and moisture brought into the cooling equipment to satisfy the ventilation air
requirement.

Time Delay Effect
Heat gain absorbed by walls, floor, furniture, etc., contributes to
space cooling load only after it has been converted to cooling load,
as described previously. Some of this stored heat gain can still be
present and converting to cooling load even after the heat gain
sources have been switched off or removed, as shown in Figure 2.
For other than purely convective heat gains, there is some delay
between the time a heat source is activated and the point when the
rate of conversion to cooling load equals the rate of heat gain
(steady-state). This time lag must be considered when calculating
cooling load, because the load required for the space can be much
lower than the instantaneous heat gain being generated, and the
space’s peak load may be significantly affected.
Accounting for the time delay effect is the major challenge in
cooling load calculations. Several methods, including the two presented in this chapter, have been developed to take the time delay
effect into consideration.

1.2

COOLING LOAD CALCULATION METHODS

This chapter presents two load calculation methods that vary significantly from previous methods. The technology involved, however (the principle of calculating a heat balance for a given space) is

not new. The first of the two methods is the heat balance (HB)
method; the second is radiant time series (RTS), which is a simplification of the HB procedure. Both methods are explained in their
respective sections.
Cooling load calculation of an actual, multiple-room building
requires a complex computer program implementing the principles
of either method.

Cooling Load Calculations in Practice
Load calculations should accurately describe the building. All
load calculation inputs should be as accurate as reasonable, without
using safety factors. Introducing compounding safety factors at
multiple levels in the load calculation results in an unrealistic and
oversized load.
Variation in heat transmission coefficients of typical building
materials and composite assemblies, differing motivations and
skills of those who construct the building, unknown infiltration
rates, and the manner in which the building is actually operated are
some of the variables that make precise calculation impossible.
Even if the designer uses reasonable procedures to account for these
factors, the calculation can never be more than a good estimate of
the actual load. Frequently, a cooling load must be calculated before
every parameter in the conditioned space can be properly or completely defined. An example is a cooling load estimate for a new
building with many floors of unleased spaces for which detailed
partition requirements, furnishings, lighting, and layout cannot be
predefined. Potential tenant modifications once the building is occupied also must be considered. Load estimating requires proper engineering judgment that includes a thorough understanding of heat
balance fundamentals.
Perimeter spaces exposed to high solar heat gain often need cooling during sunlit portions of traditional heating months, as do completely interior spaces with significant internal heat gain. These
spaces can also have significant heating loads during nonsunlit
hours or after periods of nonoccupancy, when adjacent spaces have
cooled below interior design temperatures. The heating loads
involved can be estimated conventionally to offset or to compensate
for them and prevent overheating, but they have no direct relationship to the spaces’ design heating loads.
Correct design and sizing of air-conditioning systems require
more than calculation of the cooling load in the space to be conditioned. The type of air-conditioning system, ventilation rate, reheat,
fan energy, fan location, duct heat loss and gain, duct leakage, heat
extraction lighting systems, type of return air system, and any sensible or latent heat recovery all affect system load and component
sizing. Adequate system design and component sizing require that
system performance be analyzed as a series of psychrometric processes.
System design could be driven by either sensible or latent load, and
both need to be checked. In a sensible-load-driven space (the most
common case), the cooling supply air has surplus capacity to dehumidify, but this is usually permissible. For a space driven by latent
load (e.g., an auditorium), supply airflow based on sensible load is
likely not to have enough dehumidifying capability, so subcooling
and reheating or some other dehumidification process is needed.
This chapter is primarily concerned with a given space or zone in
a building. When estimating loads for a group of spaces (e.g., for an
air-handling system that serves multiple zones), the assembled
zones must be analyzed to consider (1) the simultaneous effects taking place; (2) any diversification of heat gains for occupants, lighting, or other internal load sources; (3) ventilation; and/or (4) any
other unique circumstances. With large buildings that involve more
than a single HVAC system, simultaneous loads and any additional
diversity also must be considered when designing the central equipment that serves the systems. Methods presented in this chapter are
expressed as hourly load summaries, reflecting 24 h input schedules

18.3
and profiles of the individual load variables. Specific systems and
applications may require different profiles.

1.3

DATA ASSEMBLY

Calculating space cooling loads requires detailed building design
information and weather data at design conditions. Generally, the
following information should be compiled.
Building Characteristics. Building materials, component size,
external surface colors, and shape are usually determined from
building plans and specifications.
Configuration. Determine building location, orientation, and
external shading from building plans and specifications. Shading
from adjacent buildings can be determined from a site plan or by
visiting the proposed site, but its probable permanence should be
carefully evaluated before it is included in the calculation. The possibility of abnormally high ground-reflected solar radiation (e.g.,
from adjacent water, sand, or parking lots) or solar load from adjacent reflective buildings should not be overlooked.
Outdoor Design Conditions. Obtain appropriate weather data,
and select outdoor design conditions. Chapter 14 provides information for many weather stations; note, however, that these design drybulb and mean coincident wet-bulb temperatures may vary considerably from data traditionally used in various areas. Use judgment to
ensure that results are consistent with expectations. Also, consider
prevailing wind velocity and the relationship of a project site to the
selected weather station.
Recent research projects have greatly expanded the amount of
available weather data (e.g., ASHRAE 2012). In addition to the conventional dry bulb with mean coincident wet bulb, data are now
available for wet bulb and dew point with mean coincident dry bulb.
Peak space load generally coincides with peak solar or peak dry
bulb, but peak system load often occurs at peak wet-bulb temperature. The relationship between space and system loads is discussed
further in following sections of the chapter.
To estimate conductive heat gain through exterior surfaces and
infiltration and outdoor air loads at any time, applicable outdoor
dry- and wet-bulb temperatures must be used. Chapter 14 gives
monthly cooling load design values of outdoor conditions for many
locations. These are generally midafternoon conditions; for other
times of day, the daily range profile method described in Chapter 14
can be used to estimate dry- and wet-bulb temperatures. Peak cooling load is often determined by solar heat gain through fenestration;
this peak may occur in winter months and/or at a time of day when
outdoor air temperature is not at its maximum.
Indoor Design Conditions. Select indoor dry-bulb temperature,
indoor relative humidity, and ventilation rate. Include permissible
variations and control limits. Consult ASHRAE Standard 90.1 for
energy-savings conditions, and Standard 55 for ranges of indoor
conditions needed for thermal comfort.
Internal Heat Gains and Operating Schedules. Obtain
planned density and a proposed schedule of lighting, occupancy,
internal equipment, appliances, and processes that contribute to the
internal thermal load.
Areas. Use consistent methods for calculation of building areas.
For fenestration, the definition of a component’s area must be consistent with associated ratings.
Gross surface area. It is efficient and conservative to derive gross
surface areas from outer building dimensions, ignoring wall and
floor thicknesses and avoiding separate accounting of floor edge
and wall corner conditions. Measure floor areas to the outside of
adjacent exterior walls or to the centerline of adjacent partitions.
When apportioning to rooms, façade area should be divided at partition centerlines. Wall height should be taken as floor-to-floor
height.

Notes:
1. Tabulated values are based on 23.9°C room dry-bulb temperature. For 26.7°C room dry bulb, total heat remains the same, but sensible heat values should be decreased by approximately 20%, and latent heat values increased accordingly.

The outer-dimension procedure is expedient for load calculations, but it is not consistent with rigorous definitions used in building-related standards. The resulting differences do not introduce
significant errors in this chapter’s procedures.
Fenestration area. As discussed in Chapter 15, fenestration ratings [U-factor and solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC)] are based on
the entire product area, including frames. Thus, for load calculations, fenestration area is the area of the rough opening in the wall
or roof.
Net surface area. Net surface area is the gross surface area less
any enclosed fenestration area.

research is yielding practical models and data for the latent heat
storage of and release from common building materials.

2.2

LIGHTING

Because lighting is often a major space cooling load component,
an accurate estimate of the space heat gain it imposes is needed. Calculation of this load component is not straightforward; the rate of
cooling load from lighting at any given moment can be quite different from the heat equivalent of power supplied instantaneously to
those lights, because of heat storage.

Instantaneous Heat Gain from Lighting

2.

INTERNAL HEAT GAINS

Internal heat gains from people, lights, motors, appliances, and
equipment can contribute the majority of the cooling load in a modern building. As building envelopes have improved in response to
more restrictive energy codes, internal loads have increased because
of factors such as increased use of computers and the advent of
dense-occupancy spaces (e.g., call centers). Internal heat gain calculation techniques are identical for both heat balance (HB) and
radiant time series (RTS) cooling-load calculation methods, so
internal heat gain data are presented here independent of calculation
methods.

2.1

PEOPLE

Table 1 gives representative rates at which sensible heat and
moisture are emitted by humans in different states of activity. In
high-density spaces, such as auditoriums, these sensible and latent
heat gains comprise a large fraction of the total load. Even for shortterm occupancy, the extra sensible heat and moisture introduced by
people may be significant. See Chapter 9 for detailed information;
however, Table 1 summarizes design data for common conditions.
The conversion of sensible heat gain from people to space cooling load is affected by the thermal storage characteristics of that
space because some percentage of the sensible load is radiant
energy. Latent heat gains are usually considered instantaneous, but

The primary source of heat from lighting comes from light-emitting elements, or lamps, although significant additional heat may
be generated from ballasts and other appurtenances in the luminaires. Generally, the instantaneous rate of sensible heat gain from
electric lighting may be calculated from
qel = WFulFsa

(1)

where
qel = heat gain, W
W = total light wattage, W
Ful = lighting use factor
Fsa = lighting special allowance factor

The total light wattage is obtained from the ratings of all lamps
installed, both for general illumination and for display use. Ballasts
are not included, but are addressed by a separate factor. Wattages of
magnetic ballasts are significant; the energy consumption of highefficiency electronic ballasts might be insignificant compared to
that of the lamps.
The lighting use factor is the ratio of wattage in use, for the conditions under which the load estimate is being made, to total
installed wattage. For commercial applications such as stores, the
use factor is generally 1.0.
The special allowance factor is the ratio of the lighting fixtures’
power consumption, including lamps and ballast, to the nominal

18.4

power consumption of the lamps. For incandescent lights, this factor
is 1. For fluorescent lights, it accounts for power consumed by the
ballast as well as the ballast’s effect on lamp power consumption.
The special allowance factor can be less than 1 for electronic ballasts that lower electricity consumption below the lamp’s rated
power consumption. Use manufacturers’ values for system (lamps +
ballast) power, when available.
For high-intensity-discharge lamps (e.g. metal halide, mercury
vapor, high- and low-pressure sodium vapor lamps), the actual lighting system power consumption should be available from the manufacturer of the fixture or ballast. Ballasts available for metal halide
and high-pressure sodium vapor lamps may have special allowance
factors from about 1.3 (for low-wattage lamps) down to 1.1 (for
high-wattage lamps).
An alternative procedure is to estimate the lighting heat gain on a
per-square-metre basis. Such an approach may be required when
final lighting plans are not available. Table 2 shows the maximum
lighting power density (LPD) (lighting heat gain per square metre)
allowed by ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2019 for a range of space types.
In addition to determining the lighting heat gain, the fraction of
lighting heat gain that enters the conditioned space may need to be
distinguished from the fraction that enters an unconditioned space;
of the former category, the distribution between radiative and convective heat gain must be established.
Fisher and Chantrasrisalai (2006) and Zhou et al. (2016) experimentally studied 12 luminaire types and recommended several categories of luminaires, as shown in Table 3. The table provides a
range of design data for the conditioned space fraction, short-wave
radiative fraction, and long-wave radiative fraction under typical
operating conditions: airflow rate of 5 L/(s·m2), supply air temperature between 15 and 16.7°C, and room air temperature between 22
and 24°C. The recommended fractions in Table 3 are based on lighting heat input rates range of 9.7 to 28 W/m2. For higher design
power input, the lower bounds of the space and short-wave fractions
should be used; for design power input below this range, the upper
bounds of the space and short-wave fractions should be used. The
space fraction in the table is the fraction of lighting heat gain that
goes to the room; the fraction going to the plenum can be computed
as 1 – the space fraction. The radiative fraction is the radiative part
of the lighting heat gain that goes to the room. The convective fraction of the lighting heat gain that goes to the room is 1 – the radiative
fraction. Using values in the middle of the range yields sufficiently
accurate results. However, values that better suit a specific situation
may be determined according to the notes for Table 3.
Table 3’s data apply to both ducted and non-ducted returns. However, application of the data, particularly the ceiling plenum fraction, may vary for different return configurations. For instance, for
a room with a ducted return, although a portion of the lighting
energy initially dissipated to the ceiling plenum is quantitatively
equal to the plenum fraction, a large portion of this energy would
likely end up as the conditioned space cooling load and a small portion would end up as the cooling load to the return air.
If the space airflow rate is different from the typical condition
[i.e., about 5 L/(s·m2)], Figure 3 can be used to estimate the lighting
heat gain parameters. Design data shown in Figure 3 are only applicable for the recessed fluorescent luminaire without lens.
Although design data presented in Table 3 and Figure 3 can be
used for a vented luminaire with side-slot returns, they are likely not
applicable for a vented luminaire with lamp compartment returns,
because in the latter case, all heat convected in the vented luminaire
is likely to go directly to the ceiling plenum, resulting in zero convective fraction and a much lower space fraction. Therefore, the
design data should only be used for a configuration where conditioned air is returned through the ceiling grille or luminaire side slots.
For other luminaire types, it may be necessary to estimate the
heat gain for each component as a fraction of the total lighting heat

18.5
gain by using judgment to estimate heat-to-space and heat-to-return
percentages.
Because of the directional nature of downlight luminaires, a large
portion of the short-wave radiation typically falls on the floor. When
converting heat gains to cooling loads in the RTS method, the solar
radiant time factors (RTFs) may be more appropriate than nonsolar RTFs. (Solar RTFs are calculated assuming most solar radiation
is intercepted by the floor; nonsolar RTFs assume uniform distribution by area over all interior surfaces.) This effect may be significant
for rooms where lighting heat gain is high and for which solar RTFs
are significantly different from nonsolar RTFs.

2.3

ELECTRIC MOTORS

Instantaneous sensible heat gain from equipment operated by
electric motors in a conditioned space is calculated as
qem = 2545(P/EM)FUMFLM

(2)

where
qem = heat equivalent of equipment operation, W
P = motor power rating, W
EM = motor efficiency, decimal fraction <1.0
FUM = motor use factor, 1.0 or decimal fraction <1.0
FLM = motor load factor, 1.0 or decimal fraction <1.0

The motor use factor may be applied when motor use is known to
be intermittent, with significant nonuse during all hours of operation
(e.g., overhead door operator). For conventional applications, its
value is 1.0.
The motor load factor is the fraction of the rated load delivered
under the conditions of the cooling load estimate. Equation (2)
assumes that both the motor and driven equipment are in the conditioned space. If the motor is outside the space or airstream,
qem = 2545PFUMFLM

(3)

When the motor is inside the conditioned space or airstream but
the driven machine is outside,
 1.0 – EM 
qem = P  --------------------- FUMFLM
 EM 

(4)

Equation (4) also applies to a fan or pump in the conditioned
space that exhausts air or pumps fluid outside that space.
Table 4A and 4B gives minimum efficiencies and related data
representative of typical electric motors from ASHRAE Standard

90.1-2019. If electric motor load is an appreciable portion of cooling load, the motor efficiency should be obtained from the manufacturer. Also, depending on design, maximum efficiency might occur
anywhere between 75 to 110% of full load; if under- or overloaded,
efficiency could vary from the manufacturer’s listing.

Overloading or Underloading
Heat output of a motor is generally proportional to motor load,
within rated overload limits. Because of typically high no-load motor
current, fixed losses, and other reasons, FLM is generally assumed to
be unity, and no adjustment should be made for underloading or
overloading unless the situation is fixed and can be accurately established, and reduced-load efficiency data can be obtained from the
motor manufacturer.

Radiation and Convection
Unless the manufacturer’s technical literature indicates otherwise, motor heat gain normally should be equally divided between

radiant and convective components for the subsequent cooling load
calculations.

2.4

APPLIANCES

A cooling load estimate should take into account heat gain from
all appliances (electrical, gas, or steam). Because of the variety of
appliances, applications, schedules, use, and installations, estimates
can be very subjective. Often, the only information available about
heat gain from equipment is that on its nameplate, which can overestimate actual heat gain for many types of appliances, as discussed
in the section on Office Equipment.

Cooking Appliances
These appliances include common heat-producing cooking
equipment found in conditioned commercial kitchens.
Fundamental Principles. In commercial kitchens, appliances
are typically turned on at the beginning of each operating period and
are not turned off until closing time. Although the appliances are

a Nominal efficiencies shall be established in accordance with 10 CFR 431.
b For purposes of determining the required minimum nominal full-load efficiency of an electric motor that has a horsepower or
kilowatt rating between two horsepower or two kilowatt ratings listed in this table, each such motor shall be deemed to have a
listed horsepower or kilowatt rating, determined as follows:
1. A horsepower at or above the midpoint between the two consecutive horsepowers shall be rounded up to the higher of the two
horsepowers.
2. A horsepower below the midpoint between the two consecutive horsepowers shall be rounded down to the lower of the two
horsepowers.
3. A kilowatt rating shall be directly converted from kilowatts to horsepower using the formula 1 kilowatt = (1/0.746)
horsepower. The conversion should be calculated to three significant decimal places, and the resulting horsepower shall be
rounded in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2), whichever applies.

“up to temperature” all of the time, they may be used to cook food
less than 25% of the time. The “up to temperature” condition is
referred to as the “idle (ready to cook)” condition, while “cooking”
condition is when the appliance is being used to cook food. Due to
this operation, idle (ready to cook) heat gain measurements provide
a good estimate of heat gain for calculating cooling load
(Swierczyna et al. 2008). In estimating appliance heat gains, probabilities of simultaneous use and operation for different appliances
located in the same space should be considered.
Cooking appliances generate three types of heat gain to the
kitchen space: sensible radiant, sensible convective, and latent heat
gain. For unhooded appliances, all three types of heat gain contribute to cooling load in the kitchen space. For hooded appliances,
Marn (1962) determined that, where appliances are installed under
an effective hood, only sensible radiant gain adds to the cooling load
of the kitchen space. Convective and latent heat from cooking and
combustion products are exhausted and do not enter the kitchen

space. Gordon et al. (1994) and Smith et al. (1995) substantiated
these findings. Chapter 35 of the 2019 ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC
Applications has more information on kitchen ventilation. Marn
(1962) also concluded that appliance surfaces contributed most of
the heat to commercial kitchens and that when appliances were
installed under an effective hood, the cooling load was independent
of the fuel or energy used for similar unhooded equipment performing the same operations.
Radiant heat gain from hooded cooking equipment can range
from 15 to 45% of the actual appliance energy consumption (Gordon et al. 1994; Smith et al. 1995; Swierczyna et al. 2008; Talbert et
al. 1973). This ratio of heat gain to appliance energy consumption
may be expressed as a radiation factor, FR, and it is a function of
both appliance type and fuel source. The radiation factor is applied
to the average rate of appliance energy consumption, determined by
applying usage factor FU to the nameplate or rated energy input:

or

where FL is the ratio of sensible heat gain to the manufacturer’s
rated energy input.
ASHRAE research (Swierczyna et al. 2008, 2009) showed the
design value for heat gain from a hooded appliance at idle (ready-tocook) conditions based on its energy consumption rate is, at best, a
rough estimate. When appliance heat gain measurements during
idle conditions were regressed against energy consumption rates
for gas and electric appliances, the appliances’ emissivity, insulation, and surface cooling (e.g., through ventilation rates) scattered
the data points widely, with large deviations from the average values. Because large errors could occur in the heat gain calculation for
specific appliance types by using a general non-appliance-specific
radiation factor, the appliance-specific radiation factors or heat gain
values in Tables 5C through 5E should be applied in HVAC design
rather than calculating heat gain using a non-appliance-specific
radiation factor.
Gordon et al. (1994) and Smith et al. (1995) found that gas appliances may exhibit slightly higher heat gains than their electric counterparts under wall-canopy hoods operated at typical ventilation
rates. This is because heat contained in combustion products
exhausted from a gas appliance may increase the temperatures of
the appliance and surrounding surfaces, as well as the hood above
the appliance, more so than the heat produced by its electric counterpart. These higher-temperature surfaces radiate heat to the
kitchen, adding moderately to the radiant gain directly associated
with the appliance cooking surface.
Marn (1962) found that radiant heat temperature rise can be substantially reduced by shielding the fronts of cooking appliances.
Although this approach may not always be practical in a commercial kitchen, radiant gains can also be reduced by adding side panels
or partial enclosures that are integrated with the exhaust hood.
Heat Gain from Unhooded Cooking Appliances. Use the sensible radiant, sensible convective, and latent heat gains tabulated for
unhooded appliances at idle (ready to cook) conditions in Table 5A,
or at cooking conditions tabulated in Table 5B.
Heat Gain from Hooded Cooking Appliances. For specified or
existing appliances where the actual nameplate rating is available,
sensible radiant heat gain can be estimated using Equation (5) and
the appliance-specific radiation and usage factors in Tables 5C, 5D,
and 5E. When the appliance is not yet specified or the nameplate rat-

ing is not available, use the appliance-specific sensible radiant heat
gains tabulated in Tables 5C, 5D, and 5E.
Warewashing Applications. Typically, hot-water sanitizing and
conveyor-type dish machines have either a dishwasher/condensing
hood or direct-connected ductwork. If the ventilation is not operating properly, there are significant sensible and latent gains to the
space. Chemical sanitizing and vapor reduction models are typically
unhooded; consequently, the dish machines produce internal gains
that must be accounted for and managed by the building HVAC system.
Sensible radiant and convective gains are affected by dishwasher
insulation, and latent convective gains are affected by door seals.
Heat loads may vary.
Recirculating Systems. Cooking appliances ventilated by recirculating systems or “ductless” hoods should be treated as unhooded
appliances when estimating heat gain. In other words, all energy
consumed by the appliance and all moisture produced by cooking is
introduced to the kitchen as a sensible or latent cooling load.
Recommended Heat Gain Values. Table 5 lists recommended
rates of heat gain from typical commercial cooking appliances. Data
in the “hooded” columns assume installation under a properly
designed exhaust hood connected to a mechanical fan exhaust system operating at an exhaust rate for complete capture and containment of the thermal and effluent plume. Improperly operating hood
systems load the space with a significant convective component of
the heat gain.

Hospital and Laboratory Equipment
Hospital and laboratory equipment items are major sources of
sensible and latent heat gains in conditioned spaces. Care is needed
in evaluating the probability and duration of simultaneous usage
when many components are concentrated in one area, such as a laboratory, an operating room, etc. Commonly, heat gain from equipment in a laboratory ranges from 50 to 220 W/m2 or, in laboratories
with outdoor exposure, as much as four times the heat gain from all
other sources combined.
Medical Equipment. It is more difficult to provide generalized
heat gain recommendations for medical equipment than for general
office equipment because medical equipment is much more varied
in type and in application. Some heat gain testing has been done, but
the equipment included represents only a small sample of the type of
equipment that may be encountered.
Data presented for medical equipment in Table 6 are relevant for
portable and bench-top equipment. Medical equipment is very specific and can vary greatly from application to application. The data

are presented to provide guidance in only the most general sense.
For large equipment, such as MRI, heat gain must be obtained from
the manufacturer.
Laboratory Equipment. Equipment in laboratories is similar to
medical equipment in that it varies significantly from space to space.
Chapter 17 of the 2019 ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications
discusses heat gain from equipment, which may range from 50 to
270 W/m2 in highly automated laboratories. Table 7 lists some values for laboratory equipment, but, as with medical equipment, it is
for general guidance only. Wilkins and Cook (1999) also examined
laboratory equipment heat gains.

Office Equipment
Computers, printers, copiers, etc., can generate very significant heat gains, sometimes greater than all other gains combined. ASHRAE research project RP-822 developed a method to
measure the actual heat gain from equipment in buildings and the
radiant/convective percentages (Hosni et al. 1998; Jones et al.
1998). This methodology was then incorporated into ASHRAE
research project RP-1055 and applied to a wide range of equipment

(Hosni et al. 1999) as a follow-up to independent research by
Wilkins and McGaffin (1994) and Wilkins et al. (1991). Komor
(1997) found similar results. Analysis of measured data showed that
results for office equipment could be generalized, but results from
laboratory and hospital equipment proved too diverse. The following general guidelines for office equipment are a result of these
studies.
Nameplate Versus Measured Energy Use. Nameplate data
rarely reflect the actual power consumption of office equipment.
Actual power consumption is assumed to equal total (radiant plus
convective) heat gain, but its ratio to the nameplate value varies
widely. ASHRAE research project RP-1055 (Hosni et al. 1999)
found that, for general office equipment with nameplate power consumption of less than 1000 W, the actual ratio of total heat gain to
nameplate ranged from 25 to 50%, but when all tested equipment is
considered, the range is broader. Generally, if the nameplate value is
the only information known and no actual heat gain data are available for similar equipment, it is conservative to use 50% of nameplate as heat gain and more nearly correct if 25% of nameplate is
used. Much better results can be obtained, however, by considering

heat gain to be predictable based on the type of equipment. However, if the device has a mainly resistive internal electric load (e.g.,
a space heater), the nameplate rating may be a good estimate of its
peak energy dissipation.

Computers. Based on tests by Hosni et al. (1999) and Wilkins
and McGaffin (1994), nameplate values on computers should be
ignored when performing cooling load calculations. Tables 8A, 8B,
and 8C (Bach and Sarfraz 2018) present typical heat gain values for
computers of varying types and models.

Monitors. Table 8D shows typical values for various sizes and
types.
Flat-panel monitors have replaced CRT monitors in almost all
workplaces. Power consumption, and thus heat gain, for flat-panel
displays are significantly lower than for CRTs.
Laser Printers. Hosni et al. (1999) found that power consumption, and therefore the heat gain, of laser printers depended largely
on the level of throughput for which the printer was designed.
Smaller printers tend to be used more intermittently, and larger
printers may run continuously for longer periods.
Table 9 presents data on typical printers. These data can be
applied by taking the value for continuous operation and then applying an appropriate diversity factor. This would likely be most appropriate for larger open office areas. Another approach, which may be
appropriate for a single room or small area, is to take the value that
most closely matches the expected operation of the printer with no
diversity.
Copiers. Bach and Sarfraz (2018) also tested photocopy
machines, including desktop and office (freestanding high-volume
copiers) models. Larger machines used in production environments
were not addressed. Table 9 summarizes the results. Desktop copi-

ers rarely operate continuously, but office copiers frequently operate
continuously for periods of an hour or more. Large, high-volume
photocopiers often include provisions for exhausting air outdoors; if
so equipped, the direct-to-space or system makeup air heat gain
needs to be included in the load calculation. Also, when the air is
dry, humidifiers are often operated near copiers to limit static electricity; if this occurs during cooling mode, their load on HVAC systems should be considered.
Miscellaneous Office Equipment. Table 10 presents data on
miscellaneous office equipment such as vending machines and
other equipment tested by Bach and Sarfraz (2018).
Diversity. The ratio of measured peak electrical load at equipment panels to the sum of the maximum electrical load of each individual item of equipment is the usage diversity. A small, one- or twoperson office containing equipment listed in Tables 8 to 10 usually
contributes heat gain to the space at the sum of the appropriate listed
values. Progressively larger areas with many equipment items always
experience some degree of usage diversity resulting from whatever
percentage of such equipment is not in operation at any given time.
Wilkins and McGaffin (1994) measured diversity in 23 areas
within five different buildings totaling over 25 600 m2. Diversity

a Heat gain rates for pre-rinse equipment and unhooded dishwashers are for unhooded appliances only. For these equipment items the total appliance heat gain affects the space
directly. If an appliance is hooded or vented, the heat gain rates in the hooded and ducted sections of the table must be used. Hooded and ducted line items account for the heat
gain captured by the hood or duct and therefore only list the portion of heat gain affecting the space.
b Average surface temperature of pre-rinse equipment does not exceed 49°C which is the maximum temperature of water flowing through these devices. Average surface temperatures of the dishwashers are less than the wash tank temperature of 75°C. The surfaces are stainless steel and produce negligible radiant heat gain.
c Values given are for continuous rinsing or washing and are peak values. Rinse and wash times usually extend 1 to 3 hours after each meal period served by the food service facility.
Duration of heat gains will vary based on the operating schedule of the food service.
d For scrapper equipment the recirculation flow rate is listed.

was found to range between 37 and 78%, with the average (normalized based on area) being 46%. Figure 4 shows the relationship
between nameplate, sum of peaks, and actual electrical load with
diversity accounted for, based on the average of the total area
tested. Data on actual diversity can be used as a guide, but diversity varies significantly with occupancy. The proper diversity factor for an office of call center operators is different from that for
an office of sales representatives who travel regularly.
ASHRAE research project RP-1093 derived diversity profiles
for use in energy calculations (Abushakra et al. 2004; Claridge et al.
2004). Those profiles were derived from available measured data
sets for a variety of office buildings, and indicated a range of peak
weekday diversity factors for lighting ranging from 70 to 85% and
for receptacles (appliance load) between 42 and 89%.

Heat Gain per Unit Area. Bach and Sarfraz (2018), Wilkins and
Hosni (2000, 2011) and Wilkins and McGaffin (1994) summarized
research on a heat gain per unit area basis. Early diversity testing by
Wilkins and McGaffin showed that the actual heat gain per unit area,
or load factor, ranged from 4.7 to 11.6 W/m2, with an average (normalized based on area) of 8.7 W/m2. Spaces tested were fully occupied and highly automated, comprising 21 unique areas in five
buildings, with a computer and monitor at every workstation. These
data are from a time when equipment was primarily desktop computers with cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors, but the relative values for nameplate, sum of peaks, and actual are still applicable
today. Table 11 presents more recent data from Bach and Sarfraz
indicating a range of load factors with a subjective description of
the type of space to which they would apply. This represents more

for commercial buildings. However, including some infiltration
for spaces such entry areas or loading docks may be appropriate,
especially when those spaces are on the windward side of buildings. But the downward stack effect, as occurs when indoor air is
denser than the outdoor, might eliminate infiltration to these
entries on lower floors of tall buildings; infiltration may occur on
the upper floors during cooling conditions if makeup air is not sufficient.
Infiltration also depends on wind direction and magnitude, temperature differences, construction type and quality, and occupant
use of exterior doors and operable windows. As such, it is impossible to accurately predict infiltration rates. Designers usually predict
overall rates of infiltration using the number of air changes per
hour (ACH). A common guideline for climates and buildings typical of at least the central United States is to estimate the ACHs for
winter heating conditions, and then use half that value for the cooling load calculations.

Standard Air Volumes
concern, especially in some climates, that water may condense
within the building envelope; actively managing space air pressures to reduce this condensation problem, as well as infiltration,
may be needed. When positive air pressure is assumed, most
designers do not include infiltration in cooling load calculations

Because the specific volume of air varies appreciably, calculations are more accurate when made on the basis of air mass instead
of volume. However, volumetric flow rates are often required for
selecting coils, fans, ducts, etc.; basing volumes on measurement at
standard conditions may be used for accurate results. One standard

mally requires no correction. When airflow is to be measured at a
particular condition or point, such as at a coil entrance or exit, the
corresponding specific volume can be read from the sea-level psychrometric chart. For higher elevations, the mass flow rates of air
must be adjusted and higher-elevation psychrometric charts or algorithms must be used.

Heat Gain Calculations Using Standard Air Values
Air-conditioning design often requires the following information:
1. Total heat
Total heat gain qt corresponding to the change of a given standard
flow rate Qs through an enthalpy difference h is
qt = 1.2Qsh

(8)

The specific heats are for a range from about 75 to 90°C. When
W = 0, the value of1.20(1005 + 1884W) = 1210; when W = 0.01, the
value is 1230; when W = 0.02, the value is 1250; and when W = 0.03,
the value is 1270. Because a value of W = 0.01 approximates conditions found in many air-conditioning problems, the sensible heat
change (in watts) has traditionally been found as
qs = 1230Qst

(9)

This sensible heat equation can also be expressed as
qs = CsQst
where Cs = 1230 is the air sensible heat factor, in (W·s)/(m3·K).
3. Latent heat
Latent heat gain ql corresponding to the change of humidity ratio
W (in kgw/kgda) for given airflow (standard conditions) Qs is
ql = 1.20  2500QsW = 3000QsW

(10)

(7)

where 60 = min/h, 1.2 = kgda/m3.
This total heat equation can also be expressed as
qt = CtQsh
where Ct = 1.2 is the air total heat factor, in kgda/m3.
2. Sensible heat
Sensible heat gain qs corresponding to the change of dry-bulb
temperature t for given airflow (standard conditions) Qs is

where 2500 is the approximate heat content of 50% rh vapor at 24°C
less the heat content of water at 10°C. A common design condition
for the space is 50% rh at 24°C, and 10°C is normal condensate temperature from cooling and dehumidifying coils.
This latent heat equation can also be expressed as
ql = ClQsW
where Cl = 3000 is the air latent heat factor, in (W·s)/m3.

The constants 1200, 1230, and 3000 are useful in air-conditioning calculations at sea level (101.325 kPa) and for normal temperatures and moisture ratios. For other conditions, more precise values
should be used. For an elevation of 1525 m (84.1 kPa), appropriate
values are 998, 1023, and 2496. Equations (8) to (10) can be corrected for elevations other than sea level by multiplying them by the
ratio of pressure at sea level divided by the pressure at actual altitude. This can be derived from Equation (3) in Chapter 1 as
Cx,alt = Cx,0P/P0
where Cx,0 is any sea-level C value and P/P0 = [1 – (elevation 
2.25577  10–5]5.2559, where elevation is in metres.

Elevation Correction Examples
To correct the C values for El Paso, Texas, the elevation listed in
the appendix of Chapter 14 is 1194 m. C values for Equations (7) to
(10) can be corrected using Equation (3) in Chapter 1 as follows:
Ct,1194 = 1200 × [1 – (1194 × 2.25577 × 10–5)]5.2559 = 1040
Cs,1194 = 1230 × [1 – (1194 × 2.25577 × 10–5)]5.2559 = 1066
Cl,1194 = 3000 × [1 – (1194 × 2.25577 × 10–5)]5.2559 = 2599

18.19
hg = enthalpy at room conditions, kJ/kg
hf = enthalpy of water condensed at cooling coil, kJ/kg
hg – hf = 2500 kJ/kg when room temperature is 24°C and condensate off
coil is 10°C

3.3

Moisture sources within a building (e.g., shower areas, swimming pools or natatoriums, arboretums) can also contribute to latent
load. Unlike sensible loads, which correlate to supply air quantities
required in a space, latent loads usually only affect cooling coils sizing or refrigeration load. Because air from showers and some other
moisture-generating areas is exhausted completely, those airborne
latent loads do not reach the cooling coil and thus do not contribute
to cooling load. However, system loads associated with ventilation
air required to make up exhaust air must be recognized, and any
recirculated air’s moisture must be considered when sizing the
dehumidification equipment.
For natatoriums, occupant comfort and humidity control are critical. In many instances, size, location, and environmental requirements make complete exhaust systems expensive and ineffective.
Where recirculating mechanical cooling systems are used, evaporation (latent) loads are significant. Chapter 6 of the 2019 ASHRAE
Handbook—HVAC Applications provides guidance on natatorium
load calculations.

To correct the C values for Albuquerque, New Mexico, the elevation listed in the appendix of Chapter 14 is 1619 m. C values for
Equations (7) to (10) can be corrected as follows:
Ct,1619 = 1200 × [1 – (1619 × 2.25577 × 10–5)]5.2559 = 987
Cs,1619 = 1230 × [1 – (1619 × 2.25577 × 10–5)]5.2559 = 1012
Cl,1619 = 3000 × [1 – (1619 × 2.25577 × 10–5)]5.2559 = 2467

3.2

LATENT HEAT GAIN FROM MOISTURE
DIFFUSION

Diffusion of moisture through building materials is a natural phenomenon that is always present. Chapters 25 to 27 cover principles,
materials, and specific methods used to control moisture. Moisture
transfer through walls and roofs is often neglected in comfort air
conditioning because the actual rate is quite small and the corresponding latent heat gain is insignificant. Permeability and permeance values for various building materials are given in Chapter 26.
Vapor retarders should be specified and installed in the proper location to keep moisture transfer to a minimum, and to minimize condensation within the envelope. Moisture migration up through
slabs-on-grade and basement floors has been found to be significant, but has historically not been addressed in cooling load calculations. Under-slab continuous moisture retarders and drainage can
reduce upward moisture flow.
Some industrial applications require low moisture to be maintained in a conditioned space. In these cases, the latent heat gain
accompanying moisture transfer through walls and roofs may be
greater than any other latent heat gain. This gain is computed by
ql = MAp (h –h )

FENESTRATION HEAT GAIN

For spaces with neutral or positive air pressurization, the primary weather-related variable affecting cooling load is solar radiation. The effect of solar radiation is more pronounced and
immediate on exposed, nonopaque surfaces. Chapter 14 includes
procedures for calculating clear-sky solar radiation intensity and
incidence angles for weather conditions encountered at specific
locations. That chapter also includes some useful solar equations.
Calculation of solar heat gain and conductive heat transfer through
various glazing materials and associated mounting frames, with or
without interior and/or exterior shading devices, is discussed in
Chapter 15. This chapter covers application of such data to overall
heat gain evaluation, and conversion of calculated heat gain into a
composite cooling load for the conditioned space.

If specific window manufacturer’s SHGC and U-factor data are
available, those should be used. For fenestration equipped with
indoor shading (blinds, drapes, or shades), the indoor solar attenuation coefficients IAC(.) and IACD are listed in Tables 14A to
14G of Chapter 15.
Note that, as discussed in Chapter 15, fenestration ratings (Ufactor and SHGC) are based on the entire product area, including
frames. Thus, for load calculations, fenestration area is the area of
the entire opening in the wall or roof.

4.2

EXTERIOR SHADING

Nonuniform exterior shading, caused by roof overhangs, side
fins, or building projections, requires separate hourly calculations
for the externally shaded and unshaded areas of the window in question, with the indoor shading SHGC still used to account for any
internal shading devices. The areas, shaded and unshaded, depend
on the location of the shadow line on a surface in the plane of the
glass. Sun (1968) developed fundamental algorithms for analysis of
shade patterns. McQuiston and Spitler (1992) provide graphical
data to facilitate shadow line calculation.
Equations for calculating shade angles [Chapter 15, Equations
(34) to (37)] can be used to determine the shape and area of a moving shadow falling across a given window from external shading
elements during the course of a design day. Thus, a subprofile of
heat gain for that window can be created by separating its sunlit and
shaded areas for each hour.

HEAT BALANCE METHOD

Cooling load estimation involves calculating a surface-by-surface conductive, convective, and radiative heat balance for each
room surface and a convective heat balance for the room air. These
principles form the foundation for all methods described in this
chapter. The heat balance (HB) method solves the problem using the
most fundamental principles and the fewest simplifications. The
advantages are that it contains the fewest parameters and general
assumptions.
Some computations required by this rigorous approach require
the use of computers. The heat balance procedure is not new. Many
energy calculation programs have used it in some form for many
years. The first implementation that incorporated all the elements to
form a complete method was NBSLD (Kusuda 1967). The heat balance procedure is also implemented in both the BLAST and TARP
energy analysis programs (Walton 1983). Before ASHRAE
research project RP-875, the method had never been described completely or in a form applicable to cooling load calculations. The
papers resulting from RP-875 describe the heat balance procedure
in detail (Liesen and Pedersen 1997; McClellan and Pedersen 1997;
Pedersen et al. 1997).

The HB method is codified in the software called Hbfort that
accompanies Cooling and Heating Load Calculation Principles
(Pedersen et al. 1998).
ASHRAE research project RP-1117 constructed two model
rooms for which cooling loads were physically measured using
extensive instrumentation (Chantrasrisalai et al. 2003; Eldridge et
al. 2003; Iu et al. 2003). HB calculations closely approximated measured cooling loads when provided with detailed data for the test
rooms.

5.1

ASSUMPTIONS

All calculation procedures involve some kind of model; all models require simplifying assumptions and, therefore, are approximate. The most fundamental assumption inherent in the traditional
heat balance solution is that air in the thermal zone can be modeled
as well mixed, meaning its temperature is uniform throughout the
zone. ASHRAE research project RP-664 (Fisher and Pedersen
1997) established that this assumption is valid over a wide range of
conditions. This assumption remains the same for both convective
air system-based cooling systems and radiant cooling systems.
The next major assumption is that the surfaces of the room
(walls, windows, floor, etc.) can be treated as having
1.
2.
3.
4.

Uniform surface temperatures
Uniform long-wave (LW) and short-wave (SW)
irradiation
Diffuse radiating surfaces
One-dimensional heat conduction within

The resulting formulation is called the heat balance (HB)
model. Note that the assumptions, although common, set certain
limits on the information that can be obtained from the model.
When using heat balance to solve for the cooling load in a space
with radiant cooling, not all of the assumptions 1-4 above will apply.
In particular, not all surfaces will have uniform surface temperatures.
ASHRAE research project RP-1729 (Moftakhari et al. 2020)
developed modifications to the current implementation of heat balance to allow for solution when radiant cooling is the primary cooling system. The principles of heat balance still apply. Radiant and
convective exchanges of heat are all modeled based on the same fundamental principles. Similar considerations are required when using
heat balance for load calculation with under-floor air distribution
(UFAD) systems. With UFAD, the floor is maintained at a lower
temperature due to the below-floor air supply, so the resulting heat
exchange interactions mimic radiant systems more than convective
systems. The discussion that follows is primarily focused on the use
of heat balance with convective air system based cooling systems.

5.2

ELEMENTS

Within the framework of the assumptions, the HB can be viewed
as four distinct processes:
1. Outdoor-face heat balance
2. Wall conduction process
3. Indoor-face heat balance
4. Air heat balance
Figure 5 shows the relationship between these processes for a
single opaque surface. The top part of the figure, inside the shaded
box, is repeated for each surface enclosing the zone. The process for
transparent surfaces is similar, but the absorbed solar component
appears in the conduction process block instead of at the outdoor
face, and the absorbed component splits into inward- and outwardflowing fractions. These components participate in the surface heat
balances.

Outdoor-Face Heat Balance
The heat balance on the outdoor face of each surface is
qsol + qLWR + qconv – qko = 0

(16)

where
qsol = absorbed direct and diffuse solar radiation flux (q/A), W/m2
qLWR = net long-wave radiation flux exchange with air and
surroundings, W/m2
qconv = convective exchange flux with outdoor air, W/m2
qko = conductive flux (q/A) into wall, W/m2

All terms are positive for net flux to the face except qko, which is
traditionally taken to be positive from outdoors to inside the wall.
Each term in Equation (16) has been modeled in several ways,
and in simplified methods the first three terms are combined by
using the sol-air temperature.

Wall Conduction Process
The wall conduction process has been formulated in more ways
than any of the other processes. Techniques include
• Numerical finite difference
• Numerical finite element
• Transform methods
• Time series methods
This process introduces part of the time dependence inherent in
load calculation. Figure 6 shows surface temperatures on the indoor
and outdoor faces of the wall element, and corresponding conductive heat fluxes away from the outer face and toward the indoor face.

18.21
All four quantities are functions of time. Direct formulation of the
process uses temperature functions as input or known quantities,
and heat fluxes as outputs or resultant quantities.
In some models, surface heat transfer coefficients are included as
part of the wall element, making the temperatures in question the
indoor and outdoor air temperatures. This is not a desirable formulation, because it hides the heat transfer coefficients and prohibits
changing them as airflow conditions change. It also prohibits treating the internal long-wave radiation exchange appropriately.
Because heat balances on both sides of the element induce both
the temperature and heat flux, the solution must deal with this
simultaneous condition. Two computational methods that have been
used widely are finite difference and conduction transfer function
methods. Because of the computational time advantage, the conduction transfer function formulation has been selected for presentation
here.

Indoor-Face Heat Balance
The heart of the HB method is the internal heat balance involving
the inner faces of the zone surfaces. This heat balance has many heat
transfer components, and they are all coupled. Both long-wave
(LW) and short-wave (SW) radiation are important, as well as wall
conduction and convection to the air. The indoor-face heat balance
for each surface can be written as follows:
qLWX + qSW + qLWS + qki + qsol + qconv = 0

(17)

where
qLWX = net long-wave radiant flux exchange between zone surfaces, W/
m2
qSW = net short-wave radiation flux to surface from lights, W/m2
qLWS = long-wave radiation flux from equipment in zone, W/m2
qki = conductive flux through wall, W/m2
qsol = transmitted solar radiative flux absorbed at surface, W/m2
qconv = convective heat flux to zone air, W/m2

These terms are explained in the following paragraphs.
LW Radiation Exchange Among Zone Surfaces. The limiting
cases for modeling internal LW radiation exchange are
• Zone air is completely transparent to LW radiation
• Zone air completely absorbs LW radiation from surfaces in the
zone
Most HB models treat air as completely transparent and not participating in LW radiation exchange among surfaces in the zone.
The second model is attractive because it can be formulated simply
using a combined radiative and convective heat transfer coefficient
from each surface to the zone air and thus decouples radiant

exchange among surfaces in the zone. However, because the transparent air model allows radiant exchange and is more realistic, the
second model is inferior.
Furniture in a zone increases the amount of surface area that can
participate in radiative and convective heat exchanges. It also adds
thermal mass to the zone. These two changes can affect the time
response of the zone cooling load.
SW Radiation from Lights. The short-wavelength radiation
from lights is usually assumed to be distributed over the surfaces in
the zone in some manner. The HB procedure retains this approach
but allows the distribution function to be changed.
LW Radiation from Internal Sources. The traditional model
for this source defines a radiative/convective split for heat introduced into a zone from equipment. The radiative part is then distributed over the zone’s surfaces in some manner. This model is not
completely realistic, and it departs from HB principles. In a true HB
model, equipment surfaces are treated just as other LW radiant
sources in the zone. However, because information about the surface temperature of equipment is rarely known, it is reasonable to
keep the radiative/convective split concept even though it ignores
the true nature of the radiant exchange. ASHRAE research project
RP-1055 (Hosni et al. 1999) determined radiative/convective splits
for many additional equipment types, as listed in footnotes for
Tables 8 and 9.
Transmitted Solar Heat Gain. Chapter 15’s calculation procedure for determining transmitted solar energy through fenestration
uses the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) directly rather than
relating it to double-strength glass, as is done when using a shading
coefficient (SC). The difficulty with this plan is that the SHGC
includes both transmitted solar and inward-flowing fraction of the
solar radiation absorbed in the window. With the HB method, this
latter part should be added to the conduction component so it can be
included in the indoor-face heat balance.
Transmitted solar radiation is also distributed over surfaces in the
zone in a prescribed manner. It is possible to calculate the actual
position of beam solar radiation, but this involves partial surface
irradiation, which is inconsistent with the rest of the zone model,
which assumes uniform conditions over an entire surface.

Using SHGC to Calculate Solar Heat Gain
The total solar heat gain through fenestration consists of directly
transmitted solar radiation plus the inward-flowing fraction of solar
radiation that is absorbed in the glazing system. Both parts contain
beam and diffuse contributions. Transmitted radiation goes directly
onto surfaces in the zone and is accounted for in the surface indoor
heat balance. The zone heat balance model accommodates the
resulting heat fluxes without difficulty. The second part, the inwardflowing fraction of the absorbed solar radiation, interacts with other
surfaces of the enclosure through long-wave radiant exchange and
with zone air through convective heat transfer. As such, it depends

both on geometric and radiative properties of the zone enclosure and
convection characteristics inside and outside the zone. The solar
heat gain coefficient (SHGC) combines the transmitted solar radiation and the inward-flowing fraction of the absorbed radiation. The
SHGC is defined as
n

 Nk

SHGC =  + k=1

k

(18)

where
 = solar transmittance of glazing
k = solar absorptance of the kth layer of the glazing system
n = number of layers
Nk = inward-flowing fraction of absorbed radiation in the kth layer

Note that Equation (18) is written generically. It can be written for
a specific incidence angle and/or radiation wavelength and integrated over the wavelength and/or angle, but the principle is the
same in each case. Refer to Chapter 15 for the specific expressions.
Unfortunately, the inward-flowing fraction N interacts with the
zone in many ways. This interaction can be expressed as
N = f (indoor convection coefficient, outdoor convection coefficient,
glazing system overall heat transfer coefficient, zone geometry,
zone radiation properties)

The only way to model these interactions correctly is to combine
the window model with the zone heat balance model and solve both
simultaneously. This has been done recently in some energy analysis programs, but is not generally available in load calculation procedures. In addition, the SHGC used for rating glazing systems is
based on specific values of the indoor, outdoor, and overall heat
transfer coefficients and does not include any zonal long-wavelength radiation considerations. So, the challenge is to devise a way
to use SHGC values within the framework of heat balance calculation in the most accurate way possible, as discussed in the following
paragraphs.
Using SHGC Data. The normal incidence SHGC used to rate
and characterize glazing systems is not sufficient for determining
solar heat gain for load calculations. These calculations require
solar heat gain as a function of the incident solar angle to determine
the hour-by-hour gain profile. Thus, it is necessary to use angular
SHGC values and also diffuse SHGC values. These can be obtained
from the WINDOW 7.7.10 program (LBNL 2019). This program
does a detailed optical and thermal simulation of a glazing system
and, when applied to a single clear layer, produces the information
shown in Table 13.
Table 13 shows the parameters as a function of incident solar
angle and also the diffuse values. The specific parameters shown are
Vtc = transmittance in visible spectrum

Tsol = solar transmittance [ in Equations (18), (19), and (20)]

Abs1 = solar absorptance for layer 1, which is the only layer in this case
[ in Equations (18), (19), and (20)]

The parameters used for heat gain calculations are Tsol, Abs,
and SHGC. For the specific convective conditions assumed in
WINDOW 7.7.10 program, the inward-flowing fraction of the
absorbed solar can be obtained by rearranging Equation (18) to give
Nkk = SHGC – 

18.23
be incorporated into the procedures. It also allows determining the
sensitivity of the load calculation to these parameters.

Air Heat Balance
In HB formulations aimed at determining cooling loads, the
capacitance of air in the zone is neglected and the air heat balance is
done as a quasisteady balance in each time period. Four factors contribute to the air heat balance:
qconv + qCE + qIV + qsys = 0

(19)

(21)

where
This quantity, when multiplied by the appropriate incident solar
intensity, provides the amount of absorbed solar radiation that flows
inward. In the heat balance formulation for zone loads, this heat flux
is combined with that caused by conduction through glazing and
included in the surface heat balance.
The outward-flowing fraction of absorbed solar radiation is used
in the heat balance on the outdoor face of the glazing and is determined from
(1 – Nk)k = k – Nkk = k – (SHGC – )

(20)

If there is more than one layer, the appropriate summation of
absorptances must be done.
There is some potential inaccuracy in using the WINDOW
7.7.10 SHGC values because the inward-flowing fraction part was
determined under specific conditions for the indoor and outdoor
heat transfer coefficients. However, the program can be run with
indoor and outdoor coefficients of one’s own choosing. Normally,
however, this effect is not large, and only in highly absorptive glazing systems might cause significant error.
For solar heat gain calculations, then, it seems reasonable to use
the generic window property data that comes from WINDOW
7.7.10. Considering Table 13, the procedure is as follows:
1. Determine angle of incidence for the glazing.
2. Determine corresponding SHGC.
3. Evaluate Nkk using Equation (18).
4. Multiply Tsol by incident beam radiation intensity to get transmitted beam solar radiation.
5. Multiply Nkk by incident beam radiation intensity to get
inward-flowing absorbed heat.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 with diffuse parameters and diffuse radiation.
7. Add beam and diffuse components of transmitted and inwardflowing absorbed heat.
This procedure is incorporated into the HB method so the solar
gain is calculated accurately for each hour.
Table 10 in Chapter 15 contains SHGC information for many
additional glazing systems. That table is similar to Table 13 but is
slightly abbreviated. Again, the information needed for heat gain
calculations is Tsol, SHGC, and Abs.
The same caution about the indoor and outdoor heat transfer
coefficients applies to the information in Table 10 in Chapter 15.
Those values were also obtained with specific indoor and outdoor
heat transfer coefficients, and the inward-flowing fraction N is
dependent upon those values.
Convection to Zone Air. Indoor convection coefficients presented in past editions of this chapter and used in most load calculation procedures and energy programs are based on very old,
natural convection experiments and do not accurately describe heat
transfer coefficients in a mechanically ventilated zone. In previous
load calculation procedures, these coefficients were buried in the
procedures and could not be changed. A heat balance formulation
keeps them as working parameters. In this way, research results such
as those from ASHRAE research project RP-664 (Fisher 1998) can

qconv = convective heat transfer from surfaces, W
qCE = convective parts of internal loads, W
qIV = sensible load caused by infiltration and ventilation air, W
qsys = heat transfer to/from HVAC system, W

Convection from zone surfaces qconv is the sum of all the convective heat transfer quantities from the indoor-surface heat balance. This comes to the air through the convective heat transfer
coefficient on the surfaces.
The convective parts of the internal loads qCE is the companion
to qLWS, the radiant contribution from internal loads [Equation
(17)]. It is added directly to the air heat balance. This also violates
the tenets of the HB approach, because surfaces producing internal
loads exchange heat with zone air through normal convective processes. However, once again, this level of detail is generally not
included in the heat balance, so it is included directly into the air
heat balance instead.
In keeping with the well-mixed model for zone air, any air that
enters directly to a space through infiltration or ventilation qIV is
immediately mixed with the zone’s air. The amount of infiltration or
natural ventilation air is uncertain. Sometimes it is related to the
indoor/outdoor temperature difference and wind speed; however it
is determined, it is added directly to the air heat balance.
Conditioned air that enters the zone from the HVAC system and
provides qsys is also mixed directly with the zone air. For commercial HVAC systems, ventilation air is most often provided using outdoor air as part of this mixed-in conditioned air; ventilation air is
thus normally a system load rather than a direct-to-space load. An
exception is where infiltration or natural ventilation is used to provide all or part of the ventilation air, as discussed in Chapter 16.

5.3

GENERAL ZONE FOR LOAD CALCULATION

The HB procedure is tailored to a single thermal zone, shown in
Figure 7. The definition of a thermal zone depends on how the fixed
temperature is controlled. If air circulated through an entire building
or an entire floor is uniformly well stirred, the entire building or floor
could be considered a thermal zone. On the other hand, if each room
has a different control scheme, each room may need to be considered
as a separate thermal zone. The framework needs to be flexible
enough to accommodate any zone arrangement, but the heat balance
aspect of the procedure also requires that a complete zone be
described. This zone consists of four walls, a roof or ceiling, a floor,
and a “thermal mass surface” (described in the section on Input
Required). Each wall and the roof can include a window (or skylight
in the case of the roof). This makes a total of 12 surfaces, any of which
may have zero area if it is not present in the zone to be modeled.
The heat balance processes for this general zone are formulated
for a 24 h steady-periodic condition. The variables are the indoor
and outdoor temperatures of the 12 surfaces plus either the HVAC
system energy required to maintain a specified air temperature or
the air temperature, if system capacity is specified. This makes a
total of 25  24 = 600 variables. Although it is possible to set up the
problem for a simultaneous solution of these variables, the relatively
weak coupling of the problem from one hour to the next allows a

double iterative approach. One iteration is through all the surfaces in
each hour, and the other is through the 24 h of a day. This procedure
automatically reconciles nonlinear aspects of surface radiative
exchange and other heat flux terms.

MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION

Conduction Process
Because it links the outdoor and indoor heat balances, the wall
conduction process regulates the cooling load’s time dependence.
For the HB procedure presented here, wall conduction is formulated
using conduction transfer functions (CTFs), which relate conductive heat fluxes to current and past surface temperatures and past
heat fluxes. The general form for the indoor heat flux is

Heat Balance Equations
The primary variables in the heat balance for the general zone are
the 12 indoor face temperatures and the 12 outdoor face temperatures at each of the 24 h, assigning i as the surface index and j as the
hour index, or, in the case of CTFs, the sequence index. Thus, the
primary variables are
Tsoi,j = outdoor face temperature, i = 1,2,…,12; j = 1,2,…, 24
Tsii,j = indoor face temperature, i = 1,2,…,12; j = 1,2,…, 24
In addition, qsysj = cooling load, j = 1,2,…, 24.
Equations (16) and (23) are combined and solved for Tso to produce 12 equations applicable in each time step:

 = time step
Tsi = indoor-face temperature, °C
Tso = outdoor-face temperature, °C
qki = conductive heat flux on indoor face, W/m2
qko = conductive heat flux on outdoor face, W/m2

The subscript following the comma indicates the time period for
the quantity in terms of time step . Also, the first terms in the series
have been separated from the rest to facilitate solving for the current
temperature in the solution scheme.
The two summation limits nz and nq depend on wall construction
and also somewhat on the scheme used for calculating the CTFs. If
nq = 0, the CTFs are generally referred to as response factors, but
then theoretically nz is infinite. Values for nz and nq are generally
set to minimize the amount of computation. A development of CTFs
can be found in Hittle and Pedersen (1981).

Equation (24) shows the need to separate Xi,0, because the contribution of current surface temperature to conductive flux cannot be
collected with the other historical terms involving that temperature.
Equations (17) and (22) are combined and solved for Tsi to produce the next 12 equations:

Note that in Equations (24) and (25), the opposite surface temperature at the current time appears on the right-hand side. The two
equations could be solved simultaneously to eliminate those variables. Depending on the order of updating the other terms in the
equations, this can have a beneficial effect on solution stability.
The remaining equation comes from the air heat balance, Equation (21). This provides the cooling load qsys at each time step:

Overall HB Iterative Solution
The iterative HB procedure consists of a series of initial calculations that proceed sequentially, followed by a double iteration loop,
as shown in the following steps:
1. Initialize areas, properties, and face temperatures for all surfaces,
24 h.
2. Calculate incident and transmitted solar flux for all surfaces and
hours.
3. Distribute transmitted solar energy to all indoor faces, 24 h.
4. Calculate internal load quantities for all 24 h.
5. Distribute LW, SW, and convective energy from internal loads to
all surfaces for all hours.
6. Calculate infiltration and direct-to-space ventilation loads for all
hours.
7. Iterate the heat balance according to the following scheme:
For Day = 1 to Maxdays
For j = 1 to 24
{hours in the day}
For SurfaceIter = 1 to MaxIter
For i = 1 to 12
{The twelve zone surfaces}
Evaluate Equations (33) and (34)
Next i
Next SurfaceIter
Evaluate Equation (35)
Next j
If not converged, Next Day

8. Display results.
Generally, four or six surface iterations are sufficient to provide
convergence. The convergence check on the day iteration should be
based on the difference between the indoor and outdoor conductive
heat flux terms qk. A limit, such as requiring the difference between
all indoor and outdoor flux terms to be less than 1% of either flux,
works well.

5.5

INPUT REQUIRED

Previous methods for calculating cooling loads attempted to simplify the procedure by precalculating representative cases and
grouping the results with various correlating parameters. This generally tended to reduce the amount of information required to apply
the procedure. With heat balance, no precalculations are made, so
the procedure requires a fairly complete description of the zone.
Global Information. Because the procedure incorporates a solar
calculation, some global information is required, including latitude,
longitude, time zone, month, day of month, directional orientation
of the zone, and zone height (floor to floor). Additionally, to take
full advantage of the flexibility of the method to incorporate, for
example, variable outdoor heat transfer coefficients, things such as
wind speed, wind direction, and terrain roughness may be specified.
Normally, these variables and others default to some reasonable set
of values, but the flexibility remains.
Wall Information (Each Wall). Because the walls are involved
in three of the fundamental processes (external and internal heat balance and wall conduction), each wall of the zone requires a fairly
large set of variables. They include
• Facing angle with respect to solar exposure
• Tilt (degrees from horizontal)
• Area
• Solar absorptivity outdoors
• Long-wave emissivity outdoors
• Short-wave absorptivity indoors
• Long-wave emissivity indoors
• Exterior boundary temperature condition (solar versus nonsolar)
• External roughness
• Layer-by-layer construction information

18.25
Again, some of these parameters can be defaulted, but they are
changeable, and they indicate the more fundamental character of the
HB method because they are related to true heat transfer processes.
Window Information (Each Window). The situation for windows is similar to that for walls, but the windows require some additional information because of their role in the solar load. Necessary
parameters include
• Area
• Normal solar transmissivity
• Normal SHGC
• Normal total absorptivity
• Long-wave emissivity outdoors
• Long-wave emissivity indoor
• Surface-to-surface thermal conductance
• Reveal (for solar shading)
• Overhang width (for solar shading)
• Distance from overhang to window (for solar shading)
Roof and Floor Details. The roof and floor surfaces are specified similarly to walls. The main difference is that the ground outdoor boundary condition will probably be specified more often for
a floor.
Thermal Mass Surface Details. An “extra” surface, called a
thermal mass surface, can serve several functions. It is included in
radiant heat exchange with the other surfaces in the space but is only
exposed to the indoor air convective boundary condition. As an
example, this surface would be used to account for movable partitions in a space. Partition construction is specified layer by layer,
similar to specification for walls, and those layers store and release
heat by the same conduction mechanism as walls. As a general definition, the extra thermal mass surface should be sized to represent
all surfaces in the space that are exposed to the air mass, except the
walls, roof, floor, and windows. In the formulation, both sides of the
thermal mass participate in the exchange.
Internal Heat Gain Details. The space can be subjected to several internal heat sources: people, lights, electrical equipment, and
infiltration. Infiltration energy is assumed to go immediately into
the air heat balance, so it is the least complicated of the heat gains.
For the others, several parameters must be specified. These include
the following fractions:
• Sensible heat gain
• Latent heat gain
• Short-wave radiation
• Long-wave radiation
• Energy that enters the air immediately as convection
• Activity level of people
• Lighting heat gain that goes directly to the return air
Radiant Distribution Functions. As mentioned previously, the
generally accepted assumptions for the HB method include specifying the distribution of radiant energy from several sources to surfaces that enclose the space. This requires a distribution function
that specifies the fraction of total radiant input absorbed by each surface. The types of radiation that require distribution functions are
• Long-wave, from equipment and lights
• Short-wave, from lights
• Transmitted solar
Other Required Information. Additional flexibility is included
in the model so that results of research can be incorporated easily.
This includes the capability to specify such things as
• Heat transfer coefficients/convection models
• Solar coefficients
• Sky models

The amount of input information required may seem extensive,
but many parameters can be set to default values in most routine
applications. However, all parameters listed can be changed when
necessary to fit unusual circumstances or when additional information is obtained.

6.

RADIANT TIME SERIES (RTS)
METHOD

The radiant time series (RTS) method is a simplified method for
performing design cooling load calculations that is derived from the
heat balance (HB) method. It is intended as a more up-to-date alternative to other simplified (non-heat-balance) methods, such as the
transfer function method (TFM), the cooling load temperature difference/cooling load factor (CLTD/CLF) method, and the total
equivalent temperature difference/time averaging (TETD/TA)
method.
This method was developed to offer an approach that is rigorous,
yet does not require iterative calculations, and that quantifies each
component’s contribution to the total cooling load. In addition, it is
desirable for the user to be able to inspect and compare the coefficients for different construction and zone types in a form showing
their relative effect on the result. These characteristics of the RTS
method make it easier to apply engineering judgment during cooling load calculation.
The RTS method is suitable for peak design load calculations,
but it should not be used for annual energy simulations because of
its inherent limiting assumptions. Although simple in concept, RTS
involves too many calculations for practical use as a manual
method, although it can easily be implemented in a simple computerized spreadsheet, as shown in the examples. For a manual cooling
load calculation method, refer to the CLTD/CLF method in Chapter
28 of the 1997 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals.

6.1

ASSUMPTIONS AND PRINCIPLES

Design cooling loads are based on the assumption of steadyperiodic conditions (i.e., the design day’s weather, occupancy, and

heat gain conditions are identical to those for preceding days such
that the loads repeat on an identical 24 h cyclical basis). Thus, the
heat gain for a particular component at a particular hour is the same
as 24 h prior, which is the same as 48 h prior, etc. This assumption
is the basis for the RTS derivation from the HB method.
Cooling load calculations must address two time-delay effects
inherent in building heat transfer processes:
• Delay of conductive heat gain through opaque massive exterior
surfaces (walls, roofs, or floors)
• Delay of radiative heat gain conversion to cooling loads.
Exterior walls and roofs conduct heat because of temperature differences between outdoor and indoor air. In addition, solar energy
on exterior surfaces is absorbed, then transferred by conduction to
the building interior. Because of the mass and thermal capacity of
the wall or roof construction materials, there is a substantial time
delay in heat input at the exterior surface becoming heat gain at the
interior surface.
As described in the section on Cooling Load Principles, most
heat sources transfer energy to a room by a combination of convection and radiation. The convective part of heat gain immediately
becomes cooling load. The radiative part must first be absorbed by
the finishes and mass of the interior room surfaces, and becomes
cooling load only when it is later transferred by convection from
those surfaces to the room air. Thus, radiant heat gains become cooling loads over a delayed period of time.

6.2

OVERVIEW

Figure 8 gives an overview of the RTS method. When calculating
solar radiation, transmitted solar heat gain through windows, sol-air
temperature, and infiltration, RTS is exactly the same as previous
simplified methods (TFM and TETD/TA). Important areas that differ from previous simplified methods include
• Computation of conductive heat gain
• Splitting of all heat gains into radiant and convective portions
• Conversion of radiant heat gains into cooling loads

CTS for Light to Heavy Walls

CTS for Walls with Similar Mass and
Increasing Insulation

The RTS method accounts for both conduction time delay and
radiant time delay effects by multiplying hourly heat gains by 24 h
time series. The time series multiplication, in effect, distributes heat
gains over time. Series coefficients, which are called radiant time
factors and conduction time factors, are derived using the HB
method. Radiant time factors reflect the percentage of an earlier
radiant heat gain that becomes cooling load during the current hour.
Likewise, conduction time factors reflect the percentage of an earlier heat gain at the exterior of a wall or roof that becomes heat gain
indoors during the current hour. By definition, each radiant or conduction time series must total 100%.
These series can be used to easily compare the time-delay effect
of one construction versus another. This ability to compare choices
is of particular benefit during design, when all construction details
may not have been decided. Comparison can show the magnitude of
difference between the choices, allowing the engineer to apply judgment and make more informed assumptions in estimating the load.
Figure 9 shows conduction time series (CTS) values for three
walls with similar U-factors but with light to heavy construction.
Figure 10 shows CTS for three walls with similar construction but
with different amounts of insulation, thus with significantly different U-factors. Figure 11 shows RTS values for zones varying from
light to heavy construction .

Note that the RTS and CTS factors presented in this section were
derived using heat balance method solutions with an air-based system assumed. Specific values have not been developed that would
take into account radiant cooling systems. In the case of the CTS
factors, conduction through an exterior opaque wall is not expected
to be meaningfully different whether a radiant or convective cooling
system is used. In reality, the radiant cooling system alters inside
surface temperature of the exterior wall, so there will be differences
in the resulting heat exchange mechanics. However, based on modeling and testing completed as part of ASHRAE RP-1729
(Moftakhari et al. 2020), the impact on the timing and magnitude of
conduction heat gains is small (5 to 10%) in relation to the overall
space load.
RTS factors are used to model the conversion of stored radiant
heat gains to cooling loads. There is a difference in the conversion
of these heat gains for radiant systems compared to convective or
air-based systems. RP-1729 found that the radiant time series
method could be used with radiant cooling systems but only if RTS
factors for radiantly cooled spaces were derived. To date, RTS factors based on radiant cooling systems have not been developed
beyond the pilot examples developed for RP-1729.

6.3

RTS PROCEDURE

The general procedure for calculating cooling load for each load
component (lights, people, walls, roofs, windows, appliances, etc.)
with RTS is as follows:
1. Calculate 24 h profile of component heat gains for design day
(for conduction, first account for conduction time delay by
applying conduction time series).
2. Split heat gains into radiant and convective parts (see Table 14
for radiant and convective fractions).
3. Apply appropriate radiant time series to radiant part of heat gains
to account for time delay in conversion to cooling load.
4. Sum convective part of heat gain and delayed radiant part of heat
gain to determine cooling load for each hour for each cooling
load component.
After calculating cooling loads for each component for each
hour, sum those to determine the total cooling load for each hour and
select the hour with the peak load for design of the air-conditioning
system. Repeat this process for multiple design months to determine
the month when the peak load occurs, especially with windows on
southern exposures (northern exposure in southern latitudes), which
can result in higher peak room cooling loads in winter months than
in summer.

HEAT GAIN THROUGH EXTERIOR
SURFACES

Heat gain through exterior opaque surfaces is derived from the
same elements of solar radiation and thermal gradient as that for
fenestration areas. It differs primarily as a function of the mass and
nature of the wall or roof construction, because those elements
affect the rate of conductive heat transfer through the composite
assembly to the interior surface.

Sol-Air Temperature
Sol-air temperature is the outdoor air temperature that, in the
absence of all radiation changes gives the same rate of heat entry
into the surface as would the combination of incident solar radiation, radiant energy exchange with the sky and other outdoor surroundings, and convective heat exchange with outdoor air.
Heat Flux into Exterior Sunlit Surfaces. The heat balance at a
sunlit surface gives the heat flux into the surface q/A as
q
--- = Et + ho(to – ts) – R
A

(27)

where
 = absorptance of surface for solar radiation
Et = total solar radiation incident on surface, W/m2
ho = coefficient of heat transfer by long-wave radiation and
convection at outer surface, W/(m2·K)
to = outdoor air temperature, °C
ts = surface temperature, °C
 = hemispherical emittance of surface
R = difference between long-wave radiation incident on surface from
sky and surroundings and radiation emitted by blackbody at
outdoor air temperature, W/m2

For horizontal surfaces that receive long-wave radiation from the
sky only, an appropriate value of R is about 63 W/m2, so that if  =
1 and ho = 17 W/(m2·K), the long-wave correction term is about 4 K
(Bliss 1961).
Because vertical surfaces receive long-wave radiation from the
ground and surrounding buildings as well as from the sky, accurate
R values are difficult to determine. When solar radiation intensity
is high, surfaces of terrestrial objects usually have a higher temperature than the outdoor air; thus, their long-wave radiation compensates to some extent for the sky’s low emittance. Therefore, it is
common practice to assume R = 0 for vertical surfaces.
Tabulated Temperature Values. The sol-air temperatures in
Example Cooling and Heating Load Calculations section have been
calculated based on R/ho values of 4 K for horizontal surfaces and
0 K for vertical surfaces; total solar intensity values used for the calculations were calculated using equations in Chapter 14.
Surface Colors. Sol-air temperature values are given in the
Example Cooling and Heating Load Calculations section for two
values of the parameter /ho; the value of 0.026 is appropriate for a
light-colored surface, whereas 0.052 represents the usual maximum
value for this parameter (i.e., for a dark-colored surface or any surface for which the permanent lightness cannot reliably be anticipated). Solar absorptance values of various surfaces are included in
Table 15.
This procedure was used to calculate the sol-air temperatures
included in the Examples section. Because of the tedious solar angle
and intensity calculations, using a simple computer spreadsheet or
other software for these calculations can reduce the effort involved.

Calculating Conductive Heat Gain Using Conduction
Time Series
In the RTS method, conduction through exterior walls and roofs
is calculated using CTS values. Wall and roof conductive heat input
at the exterior is defined by the familiar conduction equation as

Assuming the rate of heat transfer can be expressed in terms of
the sol-air temperature te,

qi,-n = UA(te,-n – trc)

(30)

where
q
--- = ho(te – ts)
A

qi,n = conductive heat input for surface n hours ago, W
U = overall heat transfer coefficient for surface, W/(m2·K)
A = surface area, m2

Conduction time factors for representative wall and roof types
are included in Tables 16 and 17. Those values were derived by first
calculating conduction transfer functions for each example wall and
roof construction. Assuming steady-periodic heat input conditions
for design load calculations allows conduction transfer functions to
be reformulated into periodic response factors, as demonstrated by
Spitler and Fisher (1999a). The periodic response factors were
further simplified by dividing the 24 periodic response factors by
the respective overall wall or roof U-factor to form the conduction
time series. The conduction time factors can then be used in Equation (31) and provide a way to compare time delay characteristics
between different wall and roof constructions. Construction material data used in the calculations for walls and roofs in Tables 16 and
17 are listed in Table 18.
Heat gains calculated for walls or roofs using periodic response
factors (and thus CTS) are identical to those calculated using conduction transfer functions for the steady periodic conditions
assumed in design cooling load calculations. The methodology for
calculating periodic response factors from conduction transfer functions was originally developed as part of ASHRAE research project
RP-875 (Spitler and Fisher 1999b; Spitler et al. 1997). For walls and
roofs that are not reasonably close to the representative constructions in Tables 16 and 17, CTS coefficients may be computed with
a computer program such as that described by Iu and Fisher (2004).
For walls and roofs with thermal bridges, the procedure described
by Karambakkam et al. (2005) may be used to determine an equivalent wall construction, which can then be used as the basis for finding the CTS coefficients. When considering the level of detail
needed to make an adequate approximation, remember that, for
buildings with windows and internal heat gains, the conduction heat
gains make up a relatively small part of the cooling load. For heating
load calculations, the conduction heat loss may be more significant.
The tedious calculations involved make a simple computer
spreadsheet or other computer software a useful labor saver.

U-values can be obtained from Chapter 27. Temperature tb may
differ greatly from ti. The temperature in a kitchen or boiler room,
for example, may be as much as 8 to 28 K above the outdoor air temperature. Actual temperatures in adjoining spaces should be measured, when possible. Where nothing is known except that the
adjacent space is of conventional construction, contains no heat
sources, and itself receives no significant solar heat gain, tb – ti may
be considered the difference between the outdoor air and conditioned space design dry-bulb temperatures minus 3 K. In some
cases, air temperature in the adjacent space corresponds to the outdoor air temperature or higher.

Floors
For floors directly in contact with the ground or over an underground basement that is neither ventilated nor conditioned, sensible
heat transfer may be neglected for cooling load estimates because
usually there is a heat loss rather than a gain. An exception is in hot
climates (i.e., where average outdoor air temperature exceeds
indoor design condition), where the positive soil-to-indoor temperature difference causes sensible heat gains (Rock 2005). In many climates and for various temperatures and local soil conditions,
moisture transport up through slabs-on-grade and basement floors is
also significant, and contributes to the latent heat portion of the
cooling load.

6.6

CALCULATING COOLING LOAD

The instantaneous cooling load is the rate at which heat energy
is convected to the zone air at a given point in time. Computation of
cooling load is complicated by the radiant exchange between surfaces, furniture, partitions, and other mass in the zone. Most heat
gain sources transfer energy by both convection and radiation. Radiative heat transfer introduces a time dependency to the process that
is not easily quantified. Radiation is absorbed by thermal masses in
the zone and then later transferred by convection into the space. This
process creates a time lag and dampening effect. The convective
portion, on the other hand, is assumed to immediately become cooling load in the hour in which that heat gain occurs.
Heat balance procedures calculate the radiant exchange between
surfaces based on their surface temperatures and emissivities, but
they typically rely on estimated “radiative/convective splits” to
determine the contribution of internal loads, including people, lighting, appliances, and equipment, to the radiant exchange. RTS further simplifies the HB procedure by also relying on an estimated
radiative/convective split of wall and roof conductive heat gain
instead of simultaneously solving for the instantaneous convective
and radiative heat transfer from each surface, as in the HB
procedure.
Thus, the cooling load for each load component (lights, people,
walls, roofs, windows, appliances, etc.) for a particular hour is the
sum of the convective portion of the heat gain for that hour plus the

time-delayed portion of radiant heat gains for that hour and the previous 23 h. Table 14 contains recommendations for splitting each of
the heat gain components into convective and radiant portions.
RTS converts the radiant portion of hourly heat gains to hourly
cooling loads using radiant time factors, the coefficients of the radiant time series. Radiant time factors are used to calculate the cooling

load for the current hour on the basis of current and past heat gains.
The radiant time series for a particular zone gives the time-dependent response of the zone to a single pulse of radiant energy. The
series shows the portion of the radiant pulse that is convected to
zone air for each hour. Thus, r0 represents the fraction of the radiant
pulse convected to the zone air in the current hour r1 in the previous

convert the radiant portion of hourly heat gains to hourly cooling

Qr, = r0qr, + r1qr,–1 + r2qr,–2 + r3qr,–3 + … + r23qr,–23 (33)

The radiant cooling load for the current hour, which is calculated

required for each unique zone and for each unique radiant
energy distribution function assumption. For most common
design applications, RTS variation depends primarily on the overall massiveness of the construction and the thermal responsiveness
of the surfaces the radiant heat gains strike.
One goal in developing RTS was to provide a simplified method
based directly on the HB method; thus, it was deemed desirable to
generate RTS coefficients directly from a heat balance. A heat bal-

ance computer program was developed to do this: Hbfort, which is
included as part of Cooling and Heating Load Calculation Principles (Pedersen et al. 1998). The RTS procedure is described by
Spitler et al. (1997). The procedure for generating RTS coefficients
may be thought of as analogous to the custom weighting factor
generation procedure used by DOE 2.1 (Kerrisk et al. 1981; Sowell
1988a, 1988b). In both cases, a zone model is pulsed with a heat
gain. With DOE 2.1, the resulting loads are used to estimate the

best values of the transfer function method weighting factors to
most closely match the load profile. In the procedure described
here, a unit periodic heat gain pulse is used to generate loads for a
24 h period. As long as the heat gain pulse is a unit pulse, the resulting loads are equivalent to the RTS coefficients.
Two different radiant time series are used: solar, for direct transmitted solar heat gain (radiant energy assumed to be distributed to
the floor and furnishings only) and nonsolar, for all other types of

heat gains (radiant energy assumed to be uniformly distributed on
all internal surfaces). Nonsolar RTS apply to radiant heat gains from
people, lights, appliances, walls, roofs, and floors. Also, for diffuse
solar heat gain and direct solar heat gain from fenestration with
indoor shading (blinds, drapes, etc.), the nonsolar RTS should be
used. Radiation from those sources is assumed to be more uniformly
distributed onto all room surfaces. Effect of beam solar radiation
distribution assumptions is addressed by Hittle (1999).

Representative solar and nonsolar RTS data for light, medium,
and heavyweight constructions are provided in Tables 19 and 20.
Those were calculated using the Hbfort computer program (Pedersen et al. 1998) with zone characteristics listed in Table 21. Customized RTS values may be calculated using the HB method where the
zone is not reasonably similar to these typical zones or where more
precision is desired.

ASHRAE research project RP-942 compared HB and RTS results
over a wide range of zone types and input variables (Rees et al. 2000;
Spitler et al. 1998). In general, total cooling loads calculated using
RTS closely agreed with or were slightly higher than those of the HB
method with the same inputs. The project examined more than 5000
test cases of varying zone parameters. The dominating variable
was overall thermal mass, and results were grouped into lightweight,

U.S. medium-weight, U.K. medium-weight, and heavyweight
construction. Best agreement between RTS and HB results was
obtained for light- and medium-weight construction. Greater differences occurred in heavyweight cases, with RTS generally predicting
slightly higher peak cooling loads than HB. Greater differences also
were observed in zones with extremely high internal radiant loads

and large glazing areas or with a very lightweight exterior envelope.
In this case, heat balance calculations predict that some of the internal radiant load will be transmitted to the outdoor environment and
never becomes cooling load in the space. RTS does not account for
energy transfer out of the space to the environment, and thus predicted higher cooling loads.

ASHRAE research project RP-1117 built two model rooms for
which cooling loads were physically measured using extensive
instrumentation. The results agreed with previous simulations
(Chantrasrisalai et al. 2003; Eldridge et al. 2003; Iu et al. 2003).
HB calculations closely approximated measured cooling loads
when provided with detailed data for the test rooms. RTS overpre-

dicted measured cooling loads in tests with large, clear, singleglazed window areas with bare concrete floor and no furnishings
or internal loads. Tests under more typical conditions (venetian
blinds, carpeted floor, office-type furnishings, and normal internal
loads) provided good agreement between HB, RTS, and measured
loads.

• Temperatures outdoor conditioned spaces are generally lower
than maintained space temperatures.
• Credit for solar or internal heat gains is not included
• Thermal storage effect of building structure or content is ignored.
Thermal bridging effects on wall and roof conduction are greater
for heating loads than for cooling loads, and greater care must be
taken to account for bridging effects on U-factors used in heating
load calculations.
Heat losses (negative heat gains) are thus considered to be instantaneous, heat transfer essentially conductive, and latent heat treated
only as a function of replacing space humidity lost to the exterior
environment.
This simplified approach is justified because it evaluates
worst-case conditions that can reasonably occur during a heating
season. Therefore, the near-worst-case load is based on the following:
• Design interior and exterior conditions
• Including infiltration and/or ventilation
• No solar effect (at night or on cloudy winter days)
• Before the periodic presence of people, lights, and appliances has
an offsetting effect
Typical commercial and retail spaces have nighttime unoccupied periods at a setback temperature where little to no ventilation
is required, building lights and equipment are off, and heat loss is
primarily through conduction and infiltration. Before being occupied, buildings are warmed to the occupied temperature (see the
following discussion). During occupied time, building lights,
equipment, and people cooling loads can offset conduction heat
loss, although some perimeter heat may be required, leaving infiltration and ventilation as the primary heating loads. Ventilation
heat load may be offset with heat recovery equipment. These loads
(conduction loss, warm-up load, and ventilation load) may not be
additive when sizing building heating equipment, and it is prudent
to analyze each load and their interactions to arrive at final equipment sizing for heating.

HEAT LOSS CALCULATIONS

most of the time. A system’s failure to maintain design conditions
during brief periods of severe weather usually is not critical. However, close regulation of indoor temperature may be critical for some
occupancies or industrial processes. Design temperature data and
discussion of their application are given in Chapter 14. Generally,
the 99% temperature values given in the tabulated weather data are
used. However, caution is needed, and local conditions should
always be investigated. In some locations, outdoor temperatures are
commonly much lower and wind velocities higher than those given
in the tabulated weather data.

Indoor Design Conditions
The main purpose of the heating system is to maintain indoor
conditions that make most of the occupants comfortable. Keep in
mind, however, that the purpose of heating load calculations is to
obtain data for sizing the heating system components. In many
cases, the system will rarely be called upon to operate at the design
conditions. Therefore, the use and occupancy of the space are general considerations from the design temperature point of view.
Later, when the building’s energy requirements are computed, the
actual conditions in the space and outdoor environment, including
internal heat gains, must be considered.
The indoor design temperature should be selected at the lower end
of the acceptable temperature range, so that the heating equipment
will not be oversized. Even properly sized equipment operates under
partial load, at reduced efficiency, most of the time; therefore, any
oversizing aggravates this condition and lowers overall system efficiency. A maximum design dry-bulb temperature of 21°C is recommended for most occupancies. The indoor design value of relative
humidity should be compatible with a healthful environment and the
thermal and moisture integrity of the building envelope. A minimum
relative humidity of 30% is recommended for most situations.

Calculation of Transmission Heat Losses
Exterior Surface Above Grade. All above-grade surfaces exposed to outdoor conditions (walls, doors, ceilings, fenestration,
and raised floors) are treated identically, as follows:

The general procedure for calculation of design heat losses of a
structure is as follows:
1. Select outdoor design conditions: temperature, humidity, and
wind direction and speed.
2. Select indoor design conditions to be maintained.
3. Estimate temperature in any adjacent unheated spaces.
4. Select transmission coefficients and compute heat losses for
walls, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, and foundation elements.
5. Compute heat load through infiltration and any other outdoor air
introduced directly to the space.
6. Sum the losses caused by transmission and infiltration.

Outdoor Design Conditions
The ideal heating system provides enough heat to match the
structure’s heat loss. However, weather conditions vary considerably from year to year, and heating systems designed for the worst
weather conditions on record would have a great excess of capacity

Below-Grade Surfaces. An approximate method for estimating
below-grade heat loss [based on the work of Latta and Boileau
(1969)] assumes that the heat flow paths shown in Figure 12 can be
used to find the steady-state heat loss to the ground surface, as
follows:
HF = Uavg (tin – tgr)

The effect of soil heat capacity means that none of the usual

surface temperature fluctuates about an annual mean value by

The infiltrating air also introduces a latent heating load given by

Infiltration

ql (kW) = [(m3/s)/v](Win – Wo)Dh

Infiltration of outdoor air through openings into a structure is
caused by thermal forces, wind pressure, and negative pressure
(planned or unplanned) with respect to the outdoors created by
mechanical systems. Typically, in building design, if the mechanical systems are designed to maintain positive building pressure,
infiltration need not be considered except in ancillary spaces such
as entryways and loading areas.
Infiltration is treated as a room load and has both sensible and
latent components. During winter, this means heat and humidity
loss because cold, dry air must be heated to design temperature and
moisture must be added to increase the humidity to design condition. Typically, during winter, controlling indoor humidity is not a
factor and infiltration is reduced to a simple sensible component.
Under cooling conditions, both sensible and latent components are
added to the space load to be treated by the air conditioning system.
Procedures for estimating the infiltration rate are discussed in Chapter 16. The infiltration rate is reduced to a volumetric flow rate at a
known dry bulb/wet bulb condition. Along with indoor air condition, the following equations define the infiltration sensible and
latent loads.
qs (kW) = [(m3/s)/v)]cp (tin – to)

(43)

where
m3/s = volume flow rate of infiltrating air
cp = specific heat capacity of air, kJ/(kg·K)
v = specific volume of infiltrating air, m3/kg

Assuming standard air conditions (15°C and sea-level conditions) for v and cp , Equation (43) may be written as
qs (kW) = 1.23(m3/s)(tin – to)

where
Win = humidity ratio for indoor space air, kgw /kga
Wo = humidity ratio for outdoor air, kgw /kga
Dh = change in enthalpy to convert 1 kg water from vapor to liquid, kJ/
kg

For standard air and nominal indoor comfort conditions, the
latent load may be expressed as
ql = 3010(m3/s)(Win – Wo)

(46)

The coefficients 1.23 in Equation (44) and 3010 in Equation (46)
are given for standard conditions. They depend on temperature and
altitude (and, consequently, pressure).

7.2

HEATING SAFETY FACTORS AND LOAD
ALLOWANCES

Before mechanical cooling became common in the second half
of the 1900s, and when energy was less expensive, buildings
included much less insulation; large, operable windows; and generally more infiltration-prone assemblies than the energy-efficient and
much tighter buildings typical of today. In the past, allowances of 10
to 20% of the net calculated heating load for piping losses to
unheated spaces, and 10 to 20% more for a warm-up load, were
common practice, along with other occasional safety factors reflecting the experience and/or concern of the individual designer. Today
such safety allowances are more conservatively applied with modern construction practices. A combined warm-up/safety allowance
of 20 to 25% is common but varies depending on the particular climate, building use, and type of construction. Engineering judgment
must be applied for the particular project.

Nonresidential Cooling and Heating Load Calculations

2021 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals (SI)

Today’s more efficient buildings have smaller overall heating
loads at peak design conditions. The spare capacity in absolute
terms needed for warm-up may not be any less in the highly efficient
building than a more traditional building, assuming building mass is
the same in both cases. Simply adding the same percentage factor to
a lower peak load value may not result in enough spare capacity for
timely warm up of the building. Transient models can be used to calculate both the quasi-steady state peak heating load and the spare
capacity needed for building warm-up, but this level of analytical
rigor may not be possible for a typical building design process.
Experience and judgment must be applied, especially in cases
where the base heating system capacity has been reduced through
enhanced insulation and infiltration reduction.

7.3

OTHER HEATING CONSIDERATIONS

Calculation of design heating load estimates has essentially
become a subset of the more involved and complex estimation of
cooling loads for such spaces. Chapter 19 discusses using the heating load estimate to predict or analyze energy consumption over
time. Special provisions to deal with particular applications are covered in the 2019 ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications and the
2020 ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems and Equipment.

8.

SYSTEM HEATING AND COOLING
LOAD EFFECTS

The heat balance (HB) or radiant time series (RTS) methods are
used to determine cooling loads of rooms within a building, but they
do not address the plant size necessary to reject the heat. Principal
factors to consider in determining the plant size are ventilation, heat
transport equipment, and air distribution systems. Some of these
factors vary as a function of room load, ambient temperature, and
control strategies, so it is often necessary to evaluate the factors and
strategies dynamically and simultaneously with the heat loss or gain
calculations.
Detailed analysis of system components and methods calculating
their contribution to equipment sizing are beyond the scope of this
chapter, which is general in nature. Table 25 lists the most frequently used calculations in other chapters and volumes.

8.1

ZONING

Organization of building rooms into zones as defined for load
calculations and air-handling units has no effect on room cooling
loads. However, specific grouping and ungrouping of rooms into
zones may cause peak system loads to occur at different times
during the day or year, and may significantly affect heat removal
equipment sizes.
For example, if each room is cooled by a separate heat removal
system, the total capacity of the heat transport systems equals the
sum of peak room loads. Conditioning all rooms by a single heat
transport system (e.g., a variable-volume air handler) requires less
capacity (equal to the simultaneous peak of the combined rooms
load, which includes some rooms at off-peak loads). This may significantly reduce equipment capacity, depending on the configuration of the building.
Grouping rooms together to reduce the number of HVAC systems or zones is called thermal zoning. Zoning choices can affect
the HVAC system peak load as well as system energy performance.
A detailed introduction to thermal zoning, including examples, is
given in Rock (2018).

8.2

VENTILATION

Consult ASHRAE Standard 62.1 and building codes to determine the required quantity of ventilation air for an application, and

the various methods of achieving acceptable indoor air quality. The
following discussion is confined to the effect of mechanical ventilation on sizing heat removal equipment. Where natural ventilation
is used, through operable windows or other means, it is considered
as infiltration and is part of the direct-to-room heat gain. Where ventilation air is conditioned and supplied through the mechanical system, its sensible and latent loads are applied directly to heat
transport and central equipment, and do not affect room heating and
cooling loads. If the mechanical ventilation rate sufficiently exceeds
exhaust airflows, air pressure may be positive and infiltration from
envelope openings and outdoor wind may not be included in the
load calculations. Chapter 16 includes more information on ventilating commercial buildings.
Depending on ventilation requirements and local climate conditions, peak cooling coil loads may occur at peak dehumidification or
enthalpy conditions instead of design dry-bulb conditions. Coil
loads should be checked against all those peak conditions.

8.3

AIR HEAT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS

Heat transport equipment is usually selected to provide adequate
heating or cooling for the peak load condition. However, selection
must also consider maintaining desired indoor conditions during all
occupied hours, which requires matching the rate of heat transport
to room peak heating and cooling loads. Automatic control systems
normally vary the heating and cooling system capacity during these
off-peak hours of operation.

On/Off Control Systems
On/off control systems, common in residential and light commercial applications, cycle equipment on and off to match room
load. They are adaptable to heating or cooling because they can
cycle both heating and cooling equipment. In their purest form, their
heat transport matches the combined room and ventilation load over
a series of cycles.

Variable-Air-Volume Systems
Variable-air-volume (VAV) systems have airflow controls that
adjust cooling airflow to match the room cooling load. Damper
leakage or minimum airflow settings may cause overcooling, so
most VAV systems are used in conjunction with separate heating
systems. These may be duct-mounted heating coils, or separate radiant or convective heating systems.
The amount of heat added by the heating systems during cooling
becomes part of the room cooling load. Calculations must determine the minimum airflow relative to off-peak cooling loads. The
quantity of heat added to the cooling load can be determined for
each terminal by Equation (8) using the minimum required supply
airflow rate and the difference between supply air temperature and
the room indoor heating design temperature.

Constant-Air-Volume Reheat Systems
In constant-air-volume (CAV) reheat systems, all supply air is
cooled to remove moisture and then heated to avoid overcooling
rooms. Reheat refers to the amount of heat added to cooling supply
air to raise the supply air temperature to the temperature necessary
for picking up the sensible load. The quantity of heat added can be
determined by Equation (8).
With a constant-volume reheat system, heat transport system
load does not vary with changes in room load, unless the cooling
coil discharge temperature is allowed to vary. Where a minimum
circulation rate requires a supply air temperature greater than the
available design supply air temperature, reheat adds to the cooling
load on the heat transport system. This makes the cooling load on
the heat transport system larger than the room peak load.

PM = (1 + DL) PF /EM ED

Mixed Air Systems
Mixed air systems change the supply air temperature to match
the cooling capacity by mixing airstreams of different temperatures;
examples include multizone and dual-duct systems. Systems that
cool the entire airstream to remove moisture and to reheat some of
the air before mixing with the cooling airstream influence load on
the heat transport system in the same way a reheat system does.
Other systems separate the air paths so that mixing of hot- and colddeck airstreams does not occur. For systems that mix hot and cold
airstreams, the contribution to the heat transport system load is
determined as follows.
1. Determine the ratio of cold-deck flow to hot-deck flow from
Qh
------ = (Tc – Tr)/(Tr – Th)
Qc
2. From Equation (9), the hot-deck contribution to room load
during off-peak cooling is
qrh = 1.23Qh (Th – Tr)

where
PM = power required at input to motor, kW
ED = belt drive efficiency, dimensionless
EM = fan motor efficiency, dimensionless
PF = power required at fan shaft, kW
DL = drive loss, dimensionless

Almost all the energy required to generate airflow and static pressure
is ultimately dissipated as heat in the building and HVAC system; a
small portion is discharged with any exhaust air. Generally, it is
assumed that all the heat is released at the fan rather than dispersed
to the remainder of the system. The portion of fan heat released to the
airstream depends on the location of the fan motor and drive: if they
are within the airstream, all the energy input to the fan motor is
released to the airstream. If the fan motor and drive are outdoor the
airstream, the energy is split between the airstream and the room
housing the motor and drive. Therefore, the following equations may
be used to calculate heat generated by fans and motors:
If motor and drive are outside the airstream,
qf s = PF

where
Qh = heating airflow, L/s
Qc = cooling airflow, L/s
Tc = cooling air temperature, °C
Th = heating air temperature, °C
Tr = room or return air temperature, °C
qrh = heating airflow contribution to room load at off-peak hours, W

Heat Gain from Fans
Fans that circulate air through HVAC systems add energy to the
system through the following processes:
• Increasing velocity and static pressure adds kinetic and potential
energy
• Fan inefficiency in producing airflow and static pressure adds
sensible heat (fan heat) to the airflow
• Inefficiency of motor and drive dissipates sensible heat
The power required to provide airflow and static pressure can be
determined from the first law of thermodynamics with the following
equation:
PA = 0.009804Vp
where

qfr = (PM – PF )
If motor and drive are inside the airstream,
qf s = PM
qfr = 0.0
where
PF = power required at fan shaft, kW
PM = power required at input to motor, kW
qf s = heat release to airstream, kW
qfr = heat release to room housing motor and drive, kW

Supply airstream temperature rise may be determined from psychrometric formulas or Equation (8).
Variable- or adjustable-frequency drives (VFDs or AFDs) often
drive fan motors in VAV air-handling units. These devices release
heat to the surrounding space. Refer to manufacturers’ data for heat
released or efficiencies. The disposition of heat released is determined by the drive’s location: in the conditioned space, in the return
air path, or in a nonconditioned equipment room. These drives, and
other electronic equipment such as building control, data processing, and communications devices, are temperature sensitive, so the
rooms in which they are housed require cooling, frequently year
round.

Duct Surface Heat Transfer

PA = air power, kW
V = flow rate, m3/s
p = pressure, kPa

at standard air conditions with air density = 1.2 kg/m3 built into the
multiplier 0.009804. The power necessary at the fan shaft must
account for fan inefficiencies, which may vary from 50 to 70%. This
may be determined from
PF = PA /F
where
PF = power required at fan shaft, kW
F = fan efficiency, dimensionless

The power necessary at the input to the fan motor must account for
fan motor inefficiencies and drive losses. Fan motor efficiencies
generally vary from 80 to 95%, and drive losses for a belt drive are
3% of the fan power. This may be determined from

Heat transfer across the duct surface is one mechanism for
energy transfer to or from air inside a duct. It involves conduction
through the duct wall and insulation, convection at inner and outer
surfaces, and radiation between the duct and its surroundings.
Chapter 4 presents a rigorous analysis of duct heat loss and gain,
and Chapter 23 addresses application of analysis to insulated duct
systems.
The effect of duct heat loss or gain depends on the duct routing,
duct insulation, and its surrounding environment. Consider the following conditions:
• For duct run within the area cooled or heated by air in the duct,
heat transfer from the space to the duct has no effect on heating or
cooling load, but beware of the potential for condensation on cold
ducts.
• For duct run through unconditioned spaces or outdoors, heat
transfer adds to the cooling or heating load for the air transport
system but not for the conditioned space.

Nonresidential Cooling and Heating Load Calculations

2021 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals (SI)

• For duct run through conditioned space not served by the duct,
heat transfer affects the conditioned space as well as the air transport system serving the duct.
• For an extensive duct system, heat transfer reduces the effective
supply air differential temperature, requiring adjustment through
air balancing to increase airflow to extremities of the distribution
system.

Duct Leakage
Air leakage from supply ducts can considerably affect HVAC
system energy use. Leakage reduces cooling and/or dehumidifying capacity for the conditioned space, and must be offset by
increased airflow (sometimes reduced supply air temperatures),
unless leaked air enters the conditioned space directly. Supply air
leakage into a ceiling return plenum or leakage from unconditioned spaces into return ducts also affects return air temperature
and/or humidity.
Determining leakage from a duct system is complex because of
the variables in paths, fabrication, and installation methods. Refer
to Chapter 21 and publications from the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’ National Association (SMACNA) for methods of determining leakage. In general, good-quality ducts and
post-installation duct sealing provide highly cost-effective energy
savings, with improved thermal comfort and delivery of ventilation
air.

Ceiling Return Air Plenum Temperatures
The space above a ceiling, when used as a return air path, is a
ceiling return air plenum, or simply a return plenum. Unlike a traditional ducted return, the plenum may have multiple heat sources
in the air path. These heat sources may be radiant and convective
loads from lighting and transformers; conduction loads from adjacent walls, roofs, or glazing; or duct and piping systems within the
plenum.
As heat from these sources is picked up by the unducted return
air, the temperature differential between the ceiling cavity and conditioned space is small. Most return plenum temperatures do not rise
more than 0.6 to 1.7 K above space temperature, thus generating
only a relatively small thermal gradient for heat transfer through
plenum surfaces, except to the outdoors. This yields a relatively
large-percentage reduction in space cooling load by shifting plenum
loads to the system. Another reason plenum temperatures do not rise
more is leakage into the plenum from supply air ducts, and, if
exposed to the roof, increasing levels of insulation.
Where the ceiling space is used as a return air plenum, energy
balance requires that heat picked up from the lights into the return
air (1) become part of the cooling load to the return air (represented
by a temperature rise of return air as it passes through the ceiling
space), (2) be partially transferred back into the conditioned space
through the ceiling material below, and/or (3) be partially lost from
the space through floor surfaces above the plenum. If the plenum
has one or more exterior surfaces, heat gains through them must be
considered; if adjacent to spaces with different indoor temperatures,
partition loads must be considered, too. In a multistory building, the
conditioned space frequently gains heat through its floor from a
similar plenum below, offsetting the floor loss. The radiant component of heat leaving the ceiling or floor surface of a plenum is normally so small, because of relatively small temperature differences,
that all such heat transfer is considered convective for calculation
purposes (Rock and Wolfe 1997).
Figure 15 shows a schematic of a typical return air plenum. The
following equations, using the heat flow directions shown in Figure
15, represent the heat balance of a return air plenum design for a typical interior room in a multifloor building:
q1 = Uc Ac(tp – tr)

(47)

q2 = Uf Af (tp – tfa )

(48)

q3 = 1.1Q(tp – tr)

(49)

qlp – q2 – q1 – q3 = 0

(50)

qr + q1
Q = ---------------------------1.23  t r – t s 

(51)

where
q1 = heat gain to space from plenum through ceiling, kW
q2 = heat loss from plenum through floor above, kW
q3 = heat gain “pickup” by return air, kW
Q = return airflow, L/s
qlp = light heat gain to plenum via return air, kW
qlr = light heat gain to space, kW
qf = heat gain from plenum below, through floor, kW
qw = heat gain from exterior wall, kW
qr = space cooling load, including appropriate treatment of qlr , qf ,
and/or qw , kW
tp = plenum air temperature, °C
tr = space air temperature, °C
tfa = space air temperature of floor above, °C
ts = supply air temperature, °C

By substituting Equations (47), (48), (49), and (51) into heat balance Equation (50), tp can be found as the resultant return air temperature or plenum temperature. The results, although rigorous and
best solved by computer, are important in determining the cooling
load, which affects equipment size selection, future energy consumption, and other factors.
Equations (47) to (51) are simplified to illustrate the heat balance
relationship. Heat gain into a return air plenum is not limited to heat
from lights. Exterior walls directly exposed to the ceiling space can
transfer heat directly to or from return air. For single-story buildings
or the top floor of a multistory building, roof heat gain or loss enters
or leaves the ceiling plenum rather than the conditioned space
directly. The supply air quantity calculated by Equation (51) is only
for the conditioned space under consideration, and is assumed to
equal the return air quantity.
The amount of airflow through a return plenum above a conditioned space may not be limited to that supplied into the space; it
will, however, have no noticeable effect on plenum temperature if
the surplus comes from an adjacent plenum operating under similar
conditions. Where special conditions exist, Equations (47) to (51)
must be modified appropriately. Finally, although the building’s
thermal storage has some effect, the amount of heat entering the
return air is small and may be considered as convective for calculation purposes.

Ceiling Plenums with Ducted Returns
Compared to those in unducted plenum returns, temperatures in
ceiling plenums that have well-sealed return or exhaust air ducts
float considerably. In cooling mode, heat from lights and other
equipment raises the ceiling plenum’s temperature considerably.
Solar heat gain through a poorly insulated roof can drive the ceiling
plenum temperature to extreme levels, so much so that heat gains
to uninsulated supply air ducts in the plenum can dramatically
decrease available cooling capacity to the rooms below. In cold
weather, much heat is lost from warm supply ducts. Thus, insulating
supply air ducts and sealing them well to minimize air leaks are
highly desirable, if not essential. Appropriately insulating roofs and
plenums’ exterior walls and minimizing infiltration are also key to
lowering total building loads and improving HVAC system performance.

Underfloor Air Distribution Systems
Room cooling loads determined by methods in this chapter cannot model two distinguishing aspects of the thermal performance of
underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems under cooling operation:
• Room air stratification: UFAD systems supply cool air at the floor
and extract warmer air at the ceiling, thus creating vertical thermal stratification. Cooling load models assume a well-mixed uniform space temperature.
• Underfloor air supply plenums: cool supply air flowing through
the underfloor plenum is exposed to heat gain from both the concrete slab (conducted from the warm return air on the adjacent
floor below in a multistory building) and the raised floor panels
(conducted from the warmer room above).
Extensive simulation and experimental research led to the development of a whole-building energy simulation program capable of
modeling energy performance and load calculations for UFAD systems (Bauman et al. 2007; Webster et al. 2008). Previously, it was
thought that cooling loads for UFAD and overhead (OH) mixing
systems were nearly identical. However, energy modeling studies
show that the UFAD cooling load is generally higher than that
calculated in the same building for a well-mixed system (Schiavon
et al. 2010a). The difference is primarily caused by the thermal storage effect of the lower-mass} raised-floor panels compared to the
greater mass of a structural floor slab. Schiavon et al. (2010b)
showed that the presence of the raised floor reduces the slab’s ability
to store heat, thereby producing higher peak cooling loads for a
raised-floor system than for one without a raised floor. A second
contributing factor is that the raised-floor surface above the underfloor plenum tends to be cooler (except when illuminated by the
sun) than most other room surfaces, producing a room surface temperature distribution resembling a chilled radiant floor system,
which has a different peak cooling load than an all-air system (Feng
et al. 2012). The precise magnitude of difference in design cooling
loads between OH and UFAD systems is still under investigation,
but mainly depends on zone orientation and floor level, and possibly
the effects of furniture. Methods for determining UFAD cooling
loads will be updated as additional research results become available. For more information about simplified approaches to UFAD
cooling load calculations, see the ASHRAE Underfloor Air Distribution (UFAD) Design Guide (ASHRAE 2013), Bauman et al.
(2010), and Schiavon et al. (2010c).

Plenums in Load Calculations
Currently, most designers include ceiling and floor plenums within neighboring occupied spaces when thermally zoning a building.
However, temperatures in these plenums, and the way that they
behave, are significantly different from those of occupied spaces.
Thus, they should be defined as a separate thermal zone. Most hand

18.49
and computer-based load calculation routines, though, currently do
not allow floating air temperatures or humidities; assuming a constant air temperature in plenums, attics, and other unconditioned
spaces is a poor, but often necessary, assumption. The heat balance
method does allow floating space conditions, and when fully implemented in design load software, should allow more accurate modeling of plenums and other complex spaces.

8.4

CENTRAL PLANT

Piping
Losses must be considered for piping systems that transport heat.
For water or hydronic piping systems, heat is transferred through the
piping and insulation (see Chapter 23 for ways to determine this
transfer). However, distribution of this transferred heat depends on
the fluid in the pipe and the surrounding environment.
Consider a heating hot-water pipe. If the pipe serves a room
heater and is routed through the heated space, any heat loss from the
pipe adds heat to the room. Heat transfer to the heated space and
heat loss from the piping system is null. If the piping is exposed to
ambient conditions en route to the heater, the loss must be considered when selecting the heating equipment; if the pipe is routed
through a space requiring cooling, heat loss from the piping also
becomes a load on the cooling system.
In summary, the designer must evaluate both the magnitude of
the pipe heat transfer and the routing of the piping.

Pumps
Calculating heat gain from pumps is addressed in the section
on Electric Motors. For pumps serving hydronic systems, disposition of heat from the pumps depends on the service. For chilledwater systems, energy applied to the fluid to generate flow and
pressure becomes a chiller load. For condenser water pumps,
pumping energy must be rejected through the cooling tower. The
magnitude of pumping energy relative to cooling load is generally
small.

9. EXAMPLE COOLING AND
HEATING LOAD CALCULATIONS
To illustrate the cooling and heating load calculation procedures
discussed in this chapter, an example problem has been developed.
The objectives of this example are to demonstrate (1) the component
cooling load calculation procedures for a room using the radiant
time series (RTS) method, (2) how orientation of opaque envelope
and fenestration affects the magnitude and timing of peak room
loads, (3) how a block load accounts for load diversity among
rooms, and (4) the component heating load calculations for a room.
Table 26 summarizes RTS cooling load calculation procedures.

fenestration beam solar heat gain.

Infiltration: For purposes of this example, assume the building is
maintained under positive pressure during peak cooling conditions
and therefore has no infiltration. Assume that infiltration during peak
heating conditions is equivalent to one air change per hour.
Indoor design conditions: 23.9°C with 50% rh for cooling;
22.2°C for heating
Weather data: This example uses the Example City weather
data found in Chapter 14, Table 1: Latitude = 33.64° North, Longitude = 84.43° West, elevation = 313 m above sea level. For heating
load calculation, the heating design dry-bulb temperature is –5.6°C.
For cooling load calculations the 5% monthly design dry-bulb and
coincident wet-bulb temperature data from Chapter 14 Table 1 is
used. This is statistically equivalent to a 2% annual cooling design
condition. See Table 29 for the 24 h temperature profiles calculated
per Chapter 14.

Cooling Loads Using RTS Method
Traditionally, simplified cooling load calculation methods such
as the radiant time series (RTS) Method have estimated the total
cooling load at a particular design condition by independently calculating each component load (wall, windows, occupants, lighting,
etc.) and then summing the component loads. Although the actual
heat transfer processes for each component do affect each other, this

simplification, known as the principle of superposition, is appropriate for design load calculations and useful to the designer in
understanding the relative contribution of each component to the
total cooling load.
On the following pages RTS procedures will be demonstrated for
calculating (1) load due to internal heat gain, (2) exterior wall load,
(3) load for windows with no shading, (4) load for windows with
internal shading, (5) load for windows with internal and external
shading, and (6) the total room load. All loads will be calculated for
July 3:00 PM local standard time. Equations used in these calculations are summarized in Table 26.
Part 1. Cooling load due to internal heat gain.
Objective: Calculate the cooling load due to overhead lighting
heat gain at 3:00 PM local standard time.
Solution: Calculation of the lighting load involves the following
steps: (a) calculate the 24 h heat gain profile, (b) split those heat
gains into convective and radiant components, (c) determine the
radiant portion of the load by applying appropriate RTS factors, and
(d) sum the convective and radiant load components to determine
the total lighting load.
The heat gain profile is calculated using Equation (1) for each
hour of the day. Calculations are shown in columns b through e in

Nonresidential Cooling and Heating Load Calculations

2021 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals (SI)

Table 30. Each heat gain is designated as qi. For example, for 3:00
PM (hour 15):
{q15 = (110 W)(1.00)(100%) = 110 W

Next, the lighting heat gain is divided into convective and radiant
portions. Table 3 shows that a “Non-in-ceiling fluorescent luminaire” has a radiant factor between 0.5 and 0.57. We will use the
higher value of 0.57 or 57%. Therefore 57% of the heat gain is radiant and the remaining 43% is convective. Columns f and g in Table
30 show the results of this calculation: convective heat gain is 47 W
while radiant heat gain is 63 W.
The convective portion of the heat gain immediately becomes a
cooling load. The radiant portion undergoes a conversion process
from heat gain to cooling load which is modeled using the appropriate RTS factors. Those factors are obtained from Table 19 using the
data for medium weight construction, carpeted floor, and 50% glass.
The factors are reproduced in Table 31 in the “non-solar RTS factors, zone type 8” column. The radiant load is calculated using
Equation (33). Results are shown in column i of Table 30. For 3:00
PM, for example, the calculation is
Qr,15 = r0qr,15 + r1qr,14 + r2q r,13 + r3q r,12 + … + r23qr,16
= (0.49)(63) + (0.17)(63)
+ (0.09)(63) + (0.05)(63) + (0.03)(63)

+ (0.00)(0) + (0.00)(63) + (0.00)(63)
+ (0.00)(63) = 56 W

Solution: Determining the wall cooling load requires calculation
of: (a) the sol-air temperature at the exterior surface (b) the heat
input at the exterior surface based on sol-air temperature, (c) the
delayed heat gain through the mass of the wall to the interior surface
using conduction time series factors, (d) convective and radiant portions of the heat gain, (e) the delayed space cooling load from interior surface radiant heat gain using radiant time series factors, and
(f) the total wall load as the sum of convective and radiant load components.
First, calculate the sol-air temperature at 3:00 PM local standard
time (LST) on July 21 for a vertical, spandrel glass wall assembly,
facing 60° west of south. Key input data for the calculation is shown
in Table 32.
Sol-air temperature is calculated using Equation (29). For the
dark-colored wall, /ho = 0.053, and for vertical surfaces, R/ho =
0. The solar irradiance Et on the wall must be determined using the
equations in Chapter 14:
Solar Angles:
 = surface azimuth = +60°
 = surface tilt from horizontal (where horizontal = 0°) = 90° for
vertical wall surface
3:00 PM LST = hour 15
Calculate solar altitude, solar azimuth, surface solar azimuth, and
incident angle as follows:
From Table 2 in Chapter 14, solar position data and constants for
July 21 are
ET = –6.3536 min
 = 20.44°
Eo = 1324 W/m2
Local standard meridian (LSM) for Eastern Time Zone = –75°.

Finally, the total lighting cooling load at the designated hour is
the sum of convective and radiant portions. Table 30 shows the
results in column j. For 3:00 PM the calculation is as follows:

Total surface irradiance Et
Et = Et,b + Et,d + Et,r
= 385.1 + 86.9 + 77.9
= 549.8 W/m2
Sol-air temperature [from Equation (29)]:
Te = to + Et /ho – R/ho
= 33.1 + (0.053)(549.8) – 0
= 62.2°C

This procedure is used to calculate the sol-air temperatures for
each hour. Because of the tedious solar angle and intensity calculations, using a simple computer spreadsheet or other computer software can reduce the effort involved. A spreadsheet was used to
calculate a 24 h sol-air temperature profile for the data of this example. See Table 33A for the solar angle and intensity calculations and
Table 33B for the sol-air temperatures for this wall surface and orientation.
Next. use the sol-air temperature to calculate the heat input at the
exterior surface of the wall using Equation (30). Table 33B shows
the results of this calculation in column f. The calculation for 3:00
PM is
qi,0 = UA (te,0 – trc)
= 0.278(62.2 – 23.9)
= 59 W

With the heat input at the exterior surface known, the conduction
heat gain at the interior surface of the wall can be calculated using
Equation (31). This involves applying the conduction time series to
calculate the delay as heat flows through the wall. In Table 16, the
most similar wall construction is wall number 2. This is a spandrel
glass wall that has similar mass and thermal resistance. Conduction
time series factors for this wall are also shown in Table 31. Results
of this calculation are shown in Table 33B in column g. For example, the calculation for 3:00 PM is
q15= c0qi,15 + c1qi,14 + c2qi,13 + c3qi,12 + … + c23qi,16
= (0.025)(59) + (0.316)(50) + (0.371)(36) + (0.181)(22)
+ (0.069)(20) + (0.025)(16) + (0.009)(12) + (0.003)(7)
+ (0.001)(2) + (0.000)(-2) + (0.000)(-3) + (0.000)(-3)
+ (0.000)(-2) + (0.000)(-2) + (0.000)(-1) + (0.000)(0)
+ (0.000)(1) + (0.000)(3) + (0.000)(4) + (0.000)(6)
+ (0.000)(22) + (0.000)(45) + (0.000)(58) + (0.000)(62)
= 36 W

Next, split the conduction heat gain into convective and radiant
portions. Table 14 shows that for conduction heat gain through walls
and floors the convective fraction is 54% and the radiant fraction is
46%. Table 33B shows the division of the total heat gain into convective and radiant portions for all hours of the July design day in
columns h and i. For 3:00 PM the calculation is

= 741 / 1325
= 0.5592
Rb = cos  /sin 
= cos(58.69°) / sin(57.5°)
= 0.6162
Et,d= Ed [AI Rb + (1 – AI)(1 + cos )/2]
= 154 [(0.5592)(0.6162) + (1 – 0.5592) (1 – cos(90°))/2]
= 154 [0.5683]
= 86.9 W/m2

Qc = (36)(0.54) = 20 W

The convective heat gain will immediately become a cooling
load. The radiant portion of the heat gain will undergo a conversion
process to cooling load that is modeled using the RTS factors for the
room. The same RTS factors used in Part 1 for lighting load calculation will be applied to the wall calculation since the room conditions are the same. Table 31 lists these factors in the “non-solar RTS
factors, zone type 8” column. Table 33B shows the result of this calculation in column k. The calculation for 3:00 PM is as follows:
Qr,15 =

r0qir,15 + r1 qir,14 + r2(qir,13 + r3qir,12 + … + r23qir,16

= 12 W

Finally, the total wall cooling load is the sum of the convective
and radiant loads. Table 33B shows these results in column l. For
July 3:00 PM the calculation is as follows:
Qwall = Qc15 + Qr15 = 20 + 12 = 32 W

Part 3. Window cooling load without internal or external
shading
Objective: Calculate the cooling load for the 3.72 m2 window
facing 60° west of south for July 3:00 PM local standard time, without considering internal or external shading. Internal and external
shading will be considered in Parts 4 and 5, respectively.
Solution: Determining the window cooling load requires calculation of: (a) the 24 h window heat gain profile, (b) the convective
and radiant portions of the heat gain, (c) the conversion of the radiant heat gain into cooling load using RTS factors, and (d) the total
window load as the sum of convective and radiant loads.
First calculate the window heat gain profile using Equations (12)
to (15). Respectively, these equations calculate the direct beam solar
heat gain qb, the diffuse solar heat gain qd, the conduction heat gain
qc, and the total fenestration heat gain. The calculation uses solar
irradiance and solar angle values calculated in Part 2. The solar irradiance and solar angle values along with the window heat gain
results are shown in Table 34 in columns b through d and h through
k. For July 3:00 PM (hour 15), for example, Part 2 calculated:

Et,b = 385.1 W/m2
Et,d = 86.9 W/m2
Er

= 77.9 W/m2


= 58.7°
From Chapter 15, Table 10, for glass type 5d, qb15 = AEt,b
SHGC()(IAC) = (3.72)(385.2)(0.400)(1.00) = 573 W
qd15 = A(Et,d + Er)SHGCD(IAC)D = (3.72)(86.9 + 77.9)(0.41)(1.00)
= 251 W
qc15 = UA(tout – tin) = (3.18)(3.72)(33.1 – 23.9) = 109 W
Q15 = qb15 + qd15 + qc15 = 573 + 251 + 109 = 933 W
SHGC() = SHGC(58.7) = 0.400 (interpolated)
SHGCD = 0.41

The indoor attenuation coefficient (IAC) is 1.0 because internal
shades are not considered in this calculation.
Then, applying Equations (12) to (15) for July 3:00 PM:
qb15 = AEt,b SHGC()(IAC) = (3.72)(385.2)(0.400)(1.00) = 573 W
qd15 = A(Et,d + Er)SHGCD(IAC)D = (3.72)(86.9 + 77.9)(0.41)(1.00)
= 251 W
qc15 = UA(tout – tin) = (3.18)(3.72)(33.1 – 23.9) = 109 W
Q15 = qb15 + qd15 + qc15 = 573 + 251 + 109 = 933 W

Next, divide the window heat gain into convective and radiant
components. Because loads for windows without internal shading
(blinds, drapes, etc.) are being calculated, the direct beam solar gain
must be treated separately from the diffuse and conduction heat
gains. The direct beam heat gain is treated as 100% radiant, and the
conversion from heat gain to load uses special solar RTS factors dif-

ferent from those used to convert other types of radiant heat gain to
load. Therefore, the total window heat gain must be divided into
three parts: (1) the direct beam heat gain, (2) the radiant part of the
conduction plus diffuse solar heat gain, and (3) the convective part
of the conduction plus diffuse solar heat gain. In Table 35, columns
b to d show the direct beam component of heat gain. For conduction
and diffuse solar heat gains, Table 14 shows that for conduction heat
gains through windows where the SHGC is less than 0.5, the convective fraction of the heat gain is 54% and the radiative fraction is
46%. Columns f to j in Table 35 show how the sum of diffuse solar
and conduction heat gain is split into convective and radiant portions.
With the heat gains split into three categories, the conversion of
heat gain to cooling load can be calculated for each radiant gain.
First, for the load due to the direct beam solar heat gain is calculated
using Equation (33). The solar RTS factors from Table 20 for
medium weight construction, carpeted floor, and 50% window area
will be used. These factors are also shown in Table 31 in the column
titled “Solar RTS Factors, Room Type 8.” Cooling load results
appear in column e of Table 35. For July 3:00 PM the calculation is
as follows:
Qb,15 = r0qb,15 + r1qb,14 + r2qb,13 + r3qb,12 + … + r23qb,14
= (0.54)(573) + (0.16)(329) + (0.08)(81) + (0.04)(0)
+ (0.03)(0) + (0.02)(0) + (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0)
+ (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0)
+ (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0)
+ (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0) + (0.01)(0) + (0.00)(0)
+ (0.00)(193) + (0.00)(524) + (0.00)(695) + (0.00)(707)
= 369 W

The cooling load due to the radiant portion of the diffuse solar
and conduction window heat gain is also calculated with Equation
(33). This time the non-solar RTS factors are used. These are the
same factors used for conversion of lighting and wall conduction
heat gains to load in Parts 1 and 2. The non-solar RTS factors are
shown in Table 31 in the column titled “Non-Solar RTS Factors,
Room Type 8.” Results appear in column l of Table 35.
The convective portion of the diffuse solar and conduction window heat gains immediately converts to load and is shown Table 35
column k. The total diffuse solar and conduction load is the sum of
radiant and convective components and is shown in column m.
Finally, the total window load is the sum of the direct beam solar
load, and the diffuse solar plus convective load. These loads are
shown in Table 35 column n. For July 3:00 PM the calculation is
Qwindow = Qb + Qdiff + cond = 369 + 334 = 703 W

Part 4. Window cooling load with internal shading
Objective: Building on the window load calculation in Part 3,
calculate the window load considering internal shading due to lightcolored mini-blinds. Consider the same 3.72 m2 window facing 60°
west of south for July 3:00 PM local standard time.
Solution: Calculation of the window cooling load requires the
same four steps used in Part 3, but with different application data.
Calculate: (a) the 24 h window heat gain profile, (b) the convective
and radiant portions of the heat gain, (c) the conversion of the radiant heat gain into cooling load using RTS factors, and (d) the total
window load as the sum of convective and radiant loads.
Calculation of the 24 h heat gain profiles requires consideration
of the effect of the mini-blinds. This effect is calculated with indoor

attenuation coefficients (IAC), and different radiant and convective
fractions than an unshaded window.
IAC values depend on several factors: (1) type of shading device,
(2) position of shading device relative to window, (3) reflectivity of
shading device, (4) angular adjustment of shading device, as well as
(5) solar position relative to the shading device. These factors are
discussed in detail in Chapter 15. For this example with mini-blinds,
the IAC for beam radiation is treated separately from the IAC for
diffuse solar gain. The direct beam IAC must be adjusted based on
the profile angle of the sun.
The mini-blinds are assumed to be light colored with louver
reflectance = 0.8 and louvers positioned at a 45° angle on doubleglazed heat absorbing windows. Chapter 15 Table 14B lists IAC factors for window type 5d plus this shading type as IAC(0) = 0.74,
IAC(60) = 0.65, IAC(diff) = 0.79, and radiant fraction = 0.54.
At 3:00 PM in July, the profile angle of the sun relative to the window surface is 58.4°. Using interpolation, the beam IAC is 0.652.
The diffuse IAC is 0.79. As calculated in Part 3, SHGC() = 0.400
and SHGCD = 0.41. Thus, the window heat gains at 3:00 PM are
qb15 = A Et,b SHGC()(IAC) = (3.72)(385.2)(0.400)(0.653) = 374 W
qd15 = A(Et,d + Et,r)SHGCD(IAC)D= (3.72)(86.8 + 77.9)(0.41)(0.79)
= 198 W
qc15 = UA(tout – tin) = (3.18)(3.72)(33.1 – 23.9) = 109 W

Calculation of beam solar heat gain is shown in Table 36 columns
b through e. Calculation of the diffuse solar heat gain is shown in
columns f through i. The conduction heat gain is found in column j.
Because internal shades are used, the direct beam solar heat gain
is assumed to be absorbed by the shading device, and a portion
immediately becomes a cooling load by convection. The remaining
solar heat absorbed by the blind is assumed to be radiated to all surfaces of the room just as the diffuse and conduction heat gains are.
As a result, the beam direct solar heat gain is combined with diffuse
and conduction heat gains to obtain the total heat gain shown in column k of Table 36.
Next, the total heat gain is divided into convective and radiant
portions. For window type 5d with mini-blinds, Chapter 15 Table
14B lists a radiant fraction as 0.54. Thus 54% of the heat gain is
radiant and 46% is convective. These convective and radiant heat
gains are shown in columns l and m in Table 36.
The radiant portion of the heat gain is converted to cooling load
using Equation (33). In this equation the “Non-Solar RTS Factors,
Zone Type 8” factors from Table 31 are used. Results appear in
Table 36 in column o. The convective part of the heat gain immediately becomes a load and is shown in column n.
The total window load is then calculated combining the radiant
and convective loads. Results are shown in Table 36 column p. For
July 3:00 PM the calculation is

Qwindow = Qradiant + Qconvective = 269 + 313 = 583 W
Part 5. Window cooling load with internal and external shading

Objective: Calculate the cooling load for the window in Part 4
with the addition of a 1.5 m overhang shading the window.
Solution: As in Parts 3 and 4, determining the window cooling
load requires calculation of (a) the 24 h window heat gain profile,
(b) the convective and radiant portions of the heat gain, (c) the conversion of the radiant heat gain into cooling load using RTS factors,
and (d) the total window load as the sum of convective and radiant
loads.
The diffuse solar and conduction heat gain profiles are the same as
in Part 4 and are shown in columns h and i of Table 37. The direct
beam solar heat gain profile must be recalculated accounting for the
shading effect of the overhang. In Chapter 15, methods are described
and examples provided for calculating the area of a window shaded
by attached vertical or horizontal projections. For July 3:00 PM, the
solar position calculated in previous parts of this example is
Solar altitude  = 57.5°
Solar azimuth  74.7°
Surface-solar azimuth  = 14.7°

From Chapter 15, Equation (33), profile angle  is calculated by
tan  = tan /cos  = tan(57.5)/cos(14.7) = 1.6228

 = 58.4°

From Chapter 15, Equation (35), shadow height SH is
SH = PH tan  = 1.5(1.6228) = 2.4 m

Because the window is 1.95 m tall, at July 3:00 PM the window is
completely shaded by the 1.5 m deep overhang. Thus, the shaded window heat gain includes only diffuse solar and conduction gains for
this hour. When the shadow height is less than 1.95 m then part of the
window is exposed to direct beam solar. The sunlit area is calculated
as A = 1.91(1.95 – Sh) where 1.91 is the window width in metres. The
direct beam heat gain is then Sunlit Area × Et,b. Table 37 shows the
profile angle, shadow height, sunlit area and direct beam heat gain in
columns d through g. Note that the overhang shades the window completely for all hours except hours 16 through 19 when the solar altitude angle is low enough that part of the window is sunlit.
As in Part 4, due to the use of internal shading, direct beam solar
heat gain is combined with diffuse solar and conduction heat gains
to obtain the total heat gain shown in Table 37, column j. The total
heat gain is divided using the 46% convective fraction and 54% radiative fraction used in Part 4 for a window with internal shades.
These heat gain components are shown in Table 37, columns k and l.
The radiant heat gain is converted to cooling load using the
“Non-Solar RTS Factors, Zone Type 8” from Table 31 as before.
The radiant cooling load is shown in Table 37, column n. Combin-

ing with the convective load yields the total cooling load listed in
Table 37, column o. For July 3:00 PM the total window cooling load
is 281 W.
Part 6. Total room sensible cooling load.
Objective: Calculate the total sensible cooling load for the
example office for July 3:00 PM local standard time.
Solution: To calculate the total sensible cooling load for the
office, cooling loads for all ten heat gain components must be calculated and then summed.
Part 1 demonstrated the calculation of the lighting load. The
same general procedure can be applied to calculating the occupant
and equipment cooling loads using those component heat gains.
Part 2 demonstrated the calculation of the cooling load for the
spandrel glass wall facing 60° west of true south. The same procedures can be used to calculate wall cooling loads for the other spandrel wall section and the two sections of brick wall. In addition, the
same procedures can be used to calculate the roof load. Note that
because the ceiling space is used as a return air plenum, we are
assuming 30% of the roof load is directly absorbed by the return air
and only the remaining 70% reaches the room.
Part 5 demonstrated the calculation of the cooling load for the
window facing west of true south, with internal shading and external
overhang shading. The same procedures can be used for the window
facing east of true south.
Finally the 10 load components are summed to obtain the total
sensible load for the room. Table 38 shows the 24 h component and
total room load profiles for July. The total room load is in column l.
The 3:00 PM load is 926 W.

9.2

THE EFFECT OF ORIENTATION ON PEAK
COOLING LOAD MAGNITUDE AND TIME

A room cooling load is the combination of multiple load components, each driven by separate, independently varying heat gains.
The peak room load occurs when the sum of all component loads is
largest. This is often at a time when many of the individual component loads are not at their largest value. Among the heat gains driving loads in a room,
• There are multiple different internal sources of heat gain whose
intensity varies with time.
• Opaque envelope heat gains are a function of the thermal properties of the assembly, surface area, outdoor and indoor dry-bulb
temperature, and the orientation of the surface. Orientation affects
when the surface is exposed to solar irradiance of varying intensities.
• Fenestration heat gains are a function of the thermal and optical
performance of the fenestration assembly, surface area, outdoor
and indoor dry-bulb temperature, and orientation of the surface.
Like opaque envelope components, orientation affects when the
fenestration is exposed to solar irradiance of different intensities.
Orientation can significantly affect the peak time of individual
opaque envelope and fenestration component loads. For example,
driven by solar irradiance, an east-facing room will have peak
opaque envelope and fenestration loads earlier in the day than a
west-facing room. Orientation can also affect the time of year when
peak loads occur. In the northern hemisphere, a south-facing window will experience a peak load during a fall month due to the solar
altitude angle being lower so solar irradiance on the window is more
intense than during summer months. Because of the effect of orien-

tation, the time of peak load for individual envelope load components and for the room itself can be difficult to predict from intuition
or experience for a specific building project. As a result the common
practice is to calculate loads for a range of times of day and times of
year, and then examine the results to identify the true peak load and
time of load for individual rooms. Room load calculations are
tedious by hand, but a multiple-hour calculation is feasible using a
spreadsheet or software application for load calculation. When software is used, this typically involves calculating room loads for 24 h
design cooling days corresponding to the 21st of each month. This
section will demonstrate the importance of calculating loads for a
wide range of times of day and times of year to determine the true
peak load for rooms. If the range of times is too constrained, the
engineer risks missing the true peak load and therefore under sizing
airflow and thermal cooling capacity for the room.
In section 9.1, a detailed cooling load calculation was presented
for the example office for July 3:00 PM. This time was chosen
because it is the time of peak outdoor air dry-bulb temperature in
design-day weather profiles and historically has been assumed to be
the time of peak room load. However, July 3:00 PM is not the time of
true peak load for this room. It is not the largest load in July, and in
fact, the true peak load occurs at September 5:00 PM. Tables 38 and
39 show the detailed load profiles for July and September, respectively. Comparing Tables 38 and 39, the July peak is at 5:00 PM and
is 1029 W while the September peak in Table 39 is 1151 W at 5:00
PM (hour 17). The true peak is 12% larger than the July peak, and

24% larger than the July 3:00 PM load. Note that the internal load
components are the same in July and September. The wall loads are
smaller due to the cooler design-day outdoor temperatures in September and in spite of the higher solar irradiance on the walls. The
roof load is also lower, due both to the cooler outdoor temperatures
and lower intensity of solar irradiance on the horizontal roof surface. But the window loads are much larger due to the more intense
solar irradiance, and this overcomes the reduction in wall and roof
loads to result in a higher total room load than in July.
To illustrate the effect of orientation further, examine four copies
of the example office, each rotated 90 from the other, as shown in
Table 40. In the four cases, all room characteristics are the same
except orientation. As the table shows the peak load times vary.
• Case 1: As noted, the peak time of September 5:00 PM is driven by
the window loads due to more intense solar irradiance in fall
months. This peak load is 24% larger than the July 3:00 PM load.
• Case 2: This office also has a peak time of September 5:00 PM,
driven by the same factors as Case 1. While the northwest-facing
window will be less strongly affected by fall solar irradiance, the
effect for the southwest-facing window is strong enough to drive
the room peak to September. In this case the peak load is also 24%
larger than the July 3:00 PM load for this room.
• Case 3: Walls and windows face northerly directions and as a
result window loads and wall loads are smaller. This reduces the

effect of orientation and the peak time occurs at July 3:00 PM
when outdoor dry-bulb is at its maximum value.
• Case 4: Walls and windows face north-easterly and south-easterly.
The southeasterly facing window has higher load during the fall
months, but the northeasterly facing window does not. As a result
this case behaves like Case 3, peaking in a summer month. Note
the time of peak load is at 1:00 PM, earlier in the day than the other
cases because its exterior surfaces face eastward. In this case the
true peak is 2% larger than the July 3:00 PM load.
Finally, note that three of the four rooms do not peak at July 3:00
PM. If loads were only calculated for July 3:00 PM due to intuition
about when peak loads were likely to occur, much larger loads for
two of the cases would be missed and supply airflow and thermal
cooling capacity would be significantly undersized for these rooms.

EFFECT OF COOLING LOAD DIVERSITY ON
PEAK BLOCK LOAD

Previous sections of this example focused on calculation of peak
cooling loads for individual rooms. Room loads are important for
sizing supply airflow rates for individual rooms and cooling capacity when using room by room equipment such as water source heat
pumps or fan coil units. However, the calculation of the peak “block
load” also has relevance for building projects. The peak block load
is the largest simultaneous load among all rooms in a building, or in
a portion of a building such as a floor. The peak block load can be
used for a preliminary assessment of airflow capacity or thermal
capacity for the project. For example, a central VAV AHU only
needs sufficient airflow capacity to meet the simultaneous peak of
rooms it serves, rather than the sum of individual room peak airflow
rates. A central chiller plant only needs enough capacity to meet the
simultaneous peak load of AHUs or fan-coil units it serves rather
than the sum of individual AHU or fan-coil peak loads.
When determining the block load it is important not to sum the
individual peak room loads. Rather, room loads should be calculated for a wide range of times of day and times of year. Then for
each hour, sum the room loads to obtain an hourly block load.
Review the resulting hourly block loads across all hours calculated
to identify the peak value. This section will illustrate the concept of
calculating the peak block load.
Instead of calculating the peak block load for a full-scale building, this example will consider a simplified case where a building
contains only the four corner offices described in section 9.2 First,
loads for the four offices were calculated for a 24 h design day for
the 21st of each month. For each hour the resulting loads were
summed to obtain an hourly block load. Then the largest block load
was identified. The peak block load is 3752 W at July 5:00 PM.
In this example, the peak block load was at a different time than
all four individual room peaks shown in Table 40. Further the peak
block load is 8% less than the sum of individual room peak loads

shown at the bottom of Table 40. This difference between the peak
block load and the “sum of the peaks” load is known as load diversity. Although the diversity of 8% is relatively small in this simple
example, it can be much larger in a full scale building. The ultimate
effect of load diversity is that central HVAC equipment serving multiple rooms can be sized for a peak load that is often considerably
less than the sum of the individual peaks of those rooms.

9.4 SINGLE-ROOM DETAILED
HEATING LOAD EXAMPLE
Although the physics of heat transfer that creates heating loads is
identical to that for cooling loads, a number of traditionally used
simplifying assumptions facilitate a much simpler procedure for
peak heating load calculation. As described in the section 7.1, Heat
Loss Calculations, design heating load calculations typically
assume a single outdoor temperature with no heat gain from solar or
internal sources, under steady-state conditions. Thus, space heating
load is determined by computing the instantaneous heat transfer rate
through building envelope elements (UA T) plus heat required
because of outdoor air infiltration.
Room heating load.
Objective: Calculate the peak heating load for the example
office.
Solution: Calculation of the individual component heating loads
and the total room heating load is shown in Table 41.
For the opaque envelope components, the calculation is UA T.
For the Example City location the 99.6% heating design dry-bulb is
–5.6°C. The indoor design temperature is 22.2°C. Because solar
heat gain is not considered in calculating peak heating loads, similar
envelope elements can be combined without regard to orientation.
For example the two spandrel wall sections can be combined in a
single component load calculation. For this example the U-factors
used for cooling calculations were also used for the heating load calculation. In some climates, higher prevalent winds in winter should
be considered in calculating U-factors. Chapter 25 provides information on calculating U-factors and surface heat transfer coefficients appropriate for local wind conditions.
For heating conditions an infiltration rate of 1 air change per hour
was assumed. The room volume with a 2.74 m floor to ceiling height
is 2.74 × 12.1 = 33.2 m3 = 33 200 L. Therefore, the infiltration flow
rate at one air change per hour is (33 200 L/h)/(3600 s/h) = 9.2 L/s.
With these airflows, infiltration load can be computed using Equation (9) as shown in Table 41.
The total heating load, shown in the last row of Table 41, is 1174 W.

CONCLUSION

The example problem illustrates key issues that should be understood and accounted for in calculating peak room cooling and heating loads:
• Room peak cooling and heating loads result from many independently varying sources of heat gain or loss.
• For cooling loads, the sensible heat gain profile must be determined first and then divided into convective and radiant components. The load due to the radiant component of heat gain is
calculated considering the dynamic conversion of radiant heat
gain to load using RTS factors. Finally, the sensible room load is
computed as convective load plus radiant load.
• Peak room cooling loads occur at different times of day and times
of year depending on the orientation of exterior walls and fenestration. Calculating loads for a single point in time may miss the
true peak load and therefore risks under sizing supply airflow and
thermal cooling capacity for the room. Instead, peak room loads
should be calculated for a range of times of day and times of year
to identify the true peak cooling load.
• The relative importance of each cooling and heating load component varies, depending on the portion of the building being considered. Characteristics of a particular window may have little
effect on the entire building load, but could have a significant
effect on the supply airflow to the room where the window is
located and thus on the comfort of the occupants of that space.
• The peak block load is valuable for preliminary assessments of
airflow or thermal capacity for an entire building or a portion of
the building such as a floor. To accurately identify the peak block
load, room loads must first be computed over a range of times of
day and times of year and then summed for each hour to obtain the
block load for each hour. The peak block load is identified from
the profile of hourly block loads.

PREVIOUS COOLING LOAD
CALCULATION METHODS

Procedures described in this chapter are the most current and scientifically derived means for estimating cooling load for a defined
building space, but methods in earlier editions of the ASHRAE
Handbook are valid for many applications. These earlier procedures
are simplifications of the heat balance principles, and their use
requires experience to deal with atypical or unusual circumstances.
In fact, any cooling or heating load estimate is no better than the
assumptions used to define conditions and parameters such as physical makeup of the various envelope surfaces, conditions of occupancy and use, and ambient weather conditions. Experience of the
practitioner can never be ignored.
The primary difference between the HB and RTS methods and
the older methods is the newer methods’ direct approach, compared
to the simplifications necessitated by the limited computer capability available previously.
The transfer function method (TFM), for example, required
many calculation steps. It was originally designed for energy analysis with emphasis on daily, monthly, and annual energy use, and
thus was more oriented to average hourly cooling loads than peak
design loads.
The total equivalent temperature differential method with
time averaging (TETD/TA) has been a highly reliable (if subjective) method of load estimating since its initial presentation in the
1967 Handbook of Fundamentals. Originally intended as a manual
method of calculation, it proved suitable only as a computer application because of the need to calculate an extended profile of hourly
heat gain values, from which radiant components had to be averaged
over a time representative of the general mass of the building

involved. Because perception of thermal storage characteristics of a
given building is almost entirely subjective, with little specific information for the user to judge variations, the TETD/TA method’s primary usefulness has always been to the experienced engineer.
The cooling load temperature differential method with solar
cooling load factors (CLTD/CLF) attempted to simplify the twostep TFM and TETD/TA methods into a single-step technique that
proceeded directly from raw data to cooling load without intermediate conversion of radiant heat gain to cooling load. A series of factors were taken from cooling load calculation results (produced by
more sophisticated methods) as “cooling load temperature differences” and “cooling load factors” for use in traditional conduction
(q = UAt) equations. The results are approximate cooling load values rather than simple heat gain values. The simplifications and
assumptions used in the original work to derive those factors limit
this method’s applicability to those building types and conditions
for which the CLTD/CLF factors were derived; the method should
not be used beyond the range of applicability.
Although the TFM, TETD/TA, and CLTD/CLF procedures are
not republished in this chapter, those methods are not invalidated or
discredited. Experienced engineers have successfully used them in
millions of buildings around the world. The accuracy of cooling
load calculations in practice depends primarily on the availability of
accurate information and the design engineer’s judgment in the
assumptions made in interpreting the available data. Those factors
have much greater influence on a project’s success than does the
choice of a particular cooling load calculation method.
The primary benefit of HB and RTS calculations is their somewhat reduced dependency on purely subjective input (e.g., determining a proper time-averaging period for TETD/TA; ascertaining
appropriate safety factors to add to the rounded-off TFM results;
determining whether CLTD/CLF factors are applicable to a specific
unique application). However, using the most up-to-date techniques
in real-world design still requires judgment on the part of the design
engineer and care in choosing appropriate assumptions, just as in
applying older calculation methods.
